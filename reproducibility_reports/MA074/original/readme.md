## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA074

MA074 refers to the following article:

Harts, A. M. F., Booksmythe, I., & Jennions, M. D. (2016). Mate guarding and frequent copulation in birds: A meta-analysis of their relationship to paternity and male phenotype. _Evolution_, _70_(12), 2789â€“2808. https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13081

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `Ericson.tre`
- `Hackett.tre`
- `Q1 standard and multilevel.R`
- `Q1All.csv`
- `Q1Cat.csv`
- `Q1phylo.csv`
- `Q2All.csv`
- `Q2Cat.csv`
- `Q2phylo.csv`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA074.html` in the `output` folder.
