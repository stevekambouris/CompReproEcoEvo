# Reproducing result from

Harts, A. M. F., Booksmythe, I., & Jennions, M. D. (2016). Mate guarding and frequent copulation in birds: A meta-analysis of their relationship to paternity and male phenotype. _Evolution_, _70_(12), 2789â€“2808. https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13081

# Result to be reproduced

> Behaviors assumed to increase paternity were significantly positively related to actual paternity when looking at all measures of paternity protection combined, and when looking separately at mate guarding or manipulation of paternity protection (Fig. 2A, Table 3). (Harts et al., 2016, p.2795)

No numeric results were reported on p.2795, the first page of the results section, but the article references Table 3, on p.2796, which lists numeric results. The first result in Table 3 is the relationship (measured by Pearson correlation) between actual paternity and all measures of paternity protection combined, for dataset 1 (described on p.2794).

# Applicability of shared data and code files

## Data
The Dryad webpage contains detailed "Usage Notes" for all files listed in the archive. The usage notes indicate that the file `Q1All.csv` contains effect size data "for the relationship between paternity protection behaviours and realized paternity, across all categories of paternity protection". This seems most relevant for reproducing the selected result.

## Code
The Dryad webpage contains detailed "Usage Notes" for all files listed in the archive. The usage notes indicate that the file `Q1 standard and multilevel.R` contains code "for standard and multilevel (phylogenetic) meta analyses of the relationship between paternity protection behaviours and realized paternity". This seems most relevant for reproducing the selected result. In addition, the comments within the R script file provide further indications that this is the correct file to be using for the selected result.
