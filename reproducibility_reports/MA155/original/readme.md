## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA155

MA155 refers to the following article:

Strader, M. E., Aglyamova, G. V., & Matz, M. V. (2016). Red fluorescence in coral larvae is associated with a diapause-like state. _Molecular Ecology_, _25_(2), 559â€“569. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13488

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `KOGtableDeltaRanks.csv`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA155.html` in the `output` folder.
