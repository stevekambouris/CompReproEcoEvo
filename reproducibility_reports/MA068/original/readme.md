## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA068

MA068 refers to the following article:

Ronget, V., Gaillard, J., Coulson, T., Garratt, M., Gueyffier, F., Lega, J., & Lemaître, J. (2017). Causes and consequences of variation in offspring body mass: Meta‐analyses in birds and mammals. _Biological Reviews_, _93_(1), 1–27. https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12329

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `brv12329-sup-0001-appendixs1.csv`
- `brv12329-sup-0002-appendixs2.csv`
- `brv12329-sup-0003-appendixs3.csv`
- `brv12329-sup-0004-appendixs4.r`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA068.html` in the `output` folder.
