## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA229

MA229 refers to the following article:

Gamfeldt, L., Lefcheck, J. S., Byrnes, J. E. K., Cardinale, B. J., Duffy, J. E., & Griffin, J. N. (2015). Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning: What’s known and what’s next? _Oikos_, _124_(3), 252–265. https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.01549

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `gamfeldt appendix 1ny.txt`
- `gamfeldt appendix 2ny.txt`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA229.html` in the `output` folder.
