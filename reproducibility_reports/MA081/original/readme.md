## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA081

MA081 refers to the following article:

Jaffé, R., Pope, N., Acosta, A. L., Alves, D. A., Arias, M. C., De la Rúa, P., Francisco, F. O., Giannini, T. C., González‐Chaves, A., Imperatriz‐Fonseca, V. L., Tavares, M. G., Jha, S., & Carvalheiro, L. G. (2016). Beekeeping practices and geographic distance, not land use, drive gene flow across tropical bees. _Molecular Ecology_, _25_(21), 5345–5358. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13852

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `corMLPE.R`
- `DMA-May2015.csv`
- `DMA_rd_roads.csv`
- `Full_Script.R`
- `mavg.R`
- `MLPElikelihood_take2.cpp`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA081.html` in the `output` folder.
