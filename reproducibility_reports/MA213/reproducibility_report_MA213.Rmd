# Result to be reproduced

> The average difference between the introduced and native range (i.e. effect size) of our hypothetical trait was small (-0.07) and nonsignificant (P = 0.362) when all sample sites were pooled in our analysis (N = 654). (Colautti & Lau, 2015, p.2004)

# Details of shared data and code files

The following data and code files were shared on Dryad:

# Applicability of shared data and code files

## Data
The usage notes on the Dryad repository web page note that `SpatialStructure_Analysis.R` is the code applicable to the analysis presented in Box 1 of the article (on page 2004), see below. Given that information, the data file named `SpatialStructure_Data.csv` is logically named to be the relevant data file. The file `README_for_SpatialStructure_Data.txt` makes explicit that `SpatialStructure_Data.csv` is analysed by `SpatialStructure_Analysis.R`, and also describes the variables found in the file.

## Code
The usage notes on the Dryad repository web page note that `SpatialStructure_Analysis.R` is the code applicable to the analysis presented in Box 1 of the article (on page 2004). The code file contains enough comments to be able to follow the relevant parts of the analysis to reproduce the selected result.

# Set up
```{r library}

# Load packages required for working with original files.
library(here)

# Load custom package for (i) running the source command for specific line
# numbers within a file and (ii) for calculating the percentage error between
# the original and reproduced values.
library(reprohelper)

# Load packages required for data import/cleaning.
# (None required.)

# Load packages required by the code to run.
# (These packages are loaded in the same order as loaded in the original code
# file.)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

# Set the path to the original code file(s).
orig_source <- here::here("original", "SpatialStructure_Analysis.R")
```

# Import and clean data
```{r importdata}

# Import the data from CSV (custom code required to deal with path issues)
Locs <- read.csv(here::here("original", "SpatialStructure_Data.csv"),
                 header=TRUE)

```

sourceLines(orig_source, 21, 23)

# The test performed uses the Welch two-sample t-test. The sample size can't be
# extracted from the test output object, so just take the number of rows from
# the Locs data frame as the number of studies value.
