## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA213

MA213 refers to the following article:

Colautti, R. I., & Lau, J. A. (2015). Contemporary evolution during invasion: Evidence for differentiation, natural selection, and local adaptation. _Molecular Ecology_, _24_(9), 1999â€“2017. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13162

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `ClinesModel.r`
- `MetaPCA_Analysis.r`
- `MetaPCA_Data.csv`
- `README_MetaPCA.txt`
- `README_Selection.txt`
- `README_SpatialStructure.txt`
- `Selection_Analysis.R`
- `Selection_Data.csv`
- `SpatialStructure_Analysis.R`
- `SpatialStructure_Data.csv`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA213.html` in the `output` folder.
