## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA067

MA067 refers to the following article:

Risely, A., Klaassen, M., & Hoye, B. J. (2017). Migratory animals feel the cost of getting sick: A meta‐analysis across species. _Journal of Animal Ecology_, _87_(1), 301–314. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12766

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `Rcode.R`
- `Rcode_markdown.html`
- `README.md` (note that this is not the same as this file)
- `Supplementary file 3.csv`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA067.html` in the `output` folder.
