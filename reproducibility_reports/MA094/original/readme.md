## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA094

MA094 refers to the following article:

Turney, S., & Buddle, C. M. (2016). Pyramids of species richness: The determinants and distribution of species diversity across trophic levels. _Oikos_, _125_(9), 1224â€“1232. https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03404

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `food_web_data.csv`
- `null_models.R`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA094.html` in the `output` folder.
