## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA065

MA065 refers to the following article:

Noble, D. W. A., Stenhouse, V., & Schwanz, L. E. (2018). Developmental temperatures and phenotypic plasticity in reptiles: A systematic review and meta‐analysis. _Biological Reviews_, _93_(1), 72–97. https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12333

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `analysis_TincMeta.R`
- `explore_analysis.R`
- `figures_final.R`
- `func.R`
- `inc.csv`
- `phylo_matrices`
- `Sinv_matrices`
- `tincdat_fin.csv`
- `tincNoInc.csv`
- `tree_fin.txt`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA065.html` in the `output` folder.
