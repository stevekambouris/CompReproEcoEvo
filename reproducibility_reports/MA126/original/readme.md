## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA126

MA126 refers to the following article:

Anderson, J. T. (2016). Plant fitness in a rapidly changing world. _New Phytologist_, _210_(1), 81â€“87. https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.13693

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `nph13693-sup-0001-methods1.pdf`
- `nph13693-sup-0002-notess1.txt`
- `nph13693-sup-0003-notess2.txt`
- `nph13693-sup-0004-notess3.new`
- `nph13693-sup-0005-notess4.txt`
- `nph13693-sup-0006-notess5.new`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA126.html` in the `output` folder.
