## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA095

MA095 refers to the following article:

Gibert, A., Gray, E. F., Westoby, M., Wright, I. J., & Falster, D. S. (2016). On the link between functional traits and growth rate: Meta-analysis shows effects change with plant size, as predicted. _Journal of Ecology_, _104_(5), 1488â€“1503. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12594

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `analysis.R`
- `build.R`
- `CompileData.csv`
- `data_processing.R`
- `figures.R`
- `model.R`
- `plots.R`
- `README_for_CompileData.csv`
- `utils.R`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA095.html` in the `output` folder.
