## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA191

MA191 refers to the following article:

Voje, K. L. (2015). Scaling of Morphological Characters across Trait Type, Sex, and Environment: A Meta-analysis of Static Allometries. _The American Naturalist_, _187_(1), 89â€“98. https://doi.org/10.1086/684159

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `allometry_data.xlsx`
- `analyses and figure1 and figure 4.txt`
- `Figures 2 and 3.txt`
- `running all models in table 2.txt`
- `Table_S1.xls`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA191.html` in the `output` folder.
