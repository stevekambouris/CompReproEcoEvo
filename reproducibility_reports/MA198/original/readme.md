## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA198

MA198 refers to the following article:

Paz‐Vinas, I., Loot, G., Stevens, V. M., & Blanchet, S. (2015). Evolutionary processes driving spatial patterns of intraspecific genetic diversity in river ecosystems. _Molecular Ecology_, _24_(18), 4586–4604. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13345

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `data_meta_analyse_global.txt`
- `meta_analysis_fish.txt`
- `meta_analysis_fst.txt`
- `script_Meta_Analysis_global.R`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA198.html` in the `output` folder.
