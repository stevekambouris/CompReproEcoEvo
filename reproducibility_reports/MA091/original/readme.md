## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA091

MA091 refers to the following article:

Lemoine, N. P., Hoffman, A., Felton, A. J., Baur, L., Chaves, F., Gray, J., Yu, Q., & Smith, M. D. (2016). Underappreciated problems of low replication in ecological field studies. _Ecology_, _97_(10), 2554â€“2561. https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1506

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `Data_S1.csv`
- `Data_S2.R`
- `Data_S3.R`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA091.html` in the `output` folder.
