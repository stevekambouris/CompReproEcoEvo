## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA060

MA060 refers to the following article:

Winternitz, J., Abbate, J. L., Huchard, E., Havlíček, J., & Garamszegi, L. Z. (2017). Patterns of MHC-dependent mate selection in humans and nonhuman primates: A meta-analysis. _Molecular Ecology_, _26_(2), 668–688. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13920

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `human.primate.matechoice.csv`
- `primate_tree.nex`
- `Winternitz_et_al_Rcode_MHCDissimilarity.R`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA060.html` in the `output` folder.
