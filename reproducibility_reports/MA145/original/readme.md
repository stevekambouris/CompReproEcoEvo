## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA145

MA145 refers to the following article:

Moore, F. R., Shuker, D. M., & Dougherty, L. (2016). Stress and sexual signaling: A systematic review and meta-analysis. _Behavioral Ecology_, _27_(2), 363â€“371. https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arv195

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `Supplementary_material.docx`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA145.html` in the `output` folder.
