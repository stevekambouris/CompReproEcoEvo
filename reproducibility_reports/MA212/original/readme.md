## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA212

MA212 refers to the following article:

Valls, A., Coll, M., & Christensen, V. (2015). Keystone species: Toward an operational concept for marine biodiversity conservation. _Ecological Monographs_, _85_(1), 29â€“47. https://doi.org/10.1890/14-0306.1
