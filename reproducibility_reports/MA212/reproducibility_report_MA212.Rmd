# Reproducing result from

Valls, A., Coll, M., & Christensen, V. (2015). Keystone species: Toward an operational concept for marine biodiversity conservation. _Ecological Monographs_, _85_(1), 29â€“47. https://doi.org/10.1890/14-0306.1

# Result to be reproduced

Despite being identified as a meta-analysis, this paper does not report what might be considered a straightforward result (e.g. an estimate from a random-effects meta-analysis model). In this article, the first reported result (after an initial description of the data set used in the study) is the following:

> _Balance in the contributions of IC [impact component] and BC [biomass component] to the KS [keystoneness] indices:_ The comparison between the groups ordered by keystoneness and by trophic impact and biomass, applied to the 101 Ecopath models and for each KS index, shows that three of the KS indices out of the 12 seem to be balanced: KS3, KS7, and KS12 (Table 2). (Valls et al., 2015, pp.37-38)

The caption for Table 2 reads "Results from the comparison between groups ordered by keystoneness, and by trophic impact or biomass, for each KS index, over all selected models" (Valls et al., 2015, pp.38). The methods section of this article makes it clear that this table is the result of calculating twelve KS (keystoneness) indices for 101 data sets corresponding to particular Ecopath models from the EcoBase, and then comparing each KS index to impact and biomass indices. The results in Table 2 are counts of the number of "matches" (defined by rules set out in the methods section) among these comparisons.

The quoted result is a statement which can be found to be matched or found to be not matched, without scope to see how close the reproduced result might have been to the reported result. Therefore, the entire table of count data, and the accompanying categorisation of each row based on the pattern of the counts, will be taken as the result to be reproduced. Each cell in the table will be compared separately; the count data will be assessed in terms of percent error, while the categorisation in the "overall match" column will be assessed as a simple binary consistent/inconsistent check.

# Applicability of shared data and code files

## Data
The [explanatory description](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Supplement_1_Text_files_of_the_input_data_for_the_101_Ecopath_models_and_R_code_for_Spearman_correlation_tests_/3568704) of the files found at the Figshare site states that `InputData.rar` contains a text data file for each of the 101 Ecopath models taken from the EcoBase, where the name of each text file refers to the number of the model in the EcoBase. Each data file consists of a "matrix of the mixed trophic impact". It is clear from p.32 of the article that these matrix data files for the 101 Ecopath models are the input data for the calculation of keystoneness (KS) indices.

The results in Table 2 (which taken as a whole is the result chosen for reproduction) are based on the calculation of the twelve different KS indices considered in the article. Therefore, the data files supplied are relevant to the chosen result.

## Code
The [explanatory description](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Supplement_1_Text_files_of_the_input_data_for_the_101_Ecopath_models_and_R_code_for_Spearman_correlation_tests_/3568704) of the files found at the Figshare site states that `Rcode.R` contains "the R code used to run the Spearman rank correlation tests". The code file itself contains seven lines of code which appear to be an excerpt from a larger code base - for example, the code refers to an R object named "counter" which indicates that the Spearman correlation calculations were iterated over a number of data sets, but there is no code to indicate precisely how the data, etc. was set up to use this code snippet.

The results that are based on Spearman rank correlation tests appear in Table 3 in the article. Since the chosen result is Table 2, which does not have anything to do with Spearman rank correlations, the supplied code is not relevant to reproducing the chosen result.

**There are no code files applicable to reproducing the selected result.**

**This means that the reproduction of results can't proceed via the re-running of code, but completely new code, based on the methods described in the article, will need to be written to attempt to reproduce the result.**
