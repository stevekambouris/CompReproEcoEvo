# Reproducing result from

Grueber, C. E., Gray, L. J., Morris, K. M., Simpson, S. J., & Senior, A. M. (2018). Intergenerational effects of nutrition on immunity: A systematic review and meta-analysis. _Biological Reviews_, _93_(2), 1108â€“1124. https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12387

# Result to be reproduced

>  Considering our data set as a whole, we observed that dietary manipulation in parents led to a small, but non-statistically significant decrease in adaptive, B-cell-associated traits (MLMA _d_ = 0.205, 95% CI = -0.444 - 0.035; _N_ = 37;
Fig. 3A). (Grueber et al., 2018, p.1115)

Note: From the context, it looks like there is a typographical error in the article, and the point estimate "0.205" should in fact be "-0.205" (this is the only way the confidence interval would make sense). The result will be taken to be "-0.205".

```{r orig-result}
orig_result_df <- data.frame(ID = "MA062",
                             source = "original",
                             result_type = "mean",
                             es_type = "Hedges' d",
                             point_est = -0.205,
                             ci_lower = -0.444,
                             ci_upper = 0.035,
                             n = 37)

# Details of shared data and code files

The following data and code files were shared as supporting information on the web page for the article (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12387):

* brv12387-sup-0001-AppendixS1.xlsx
* brv12387-sup-0002-AppendixS2.R

There is no licencing information available for these files.

# Applicability of shared data and code files

## Data
Section VIII (Supporting information) in the article mentions that Appendix S1 online contains the data extracted from the studies included in the meta-analysis.

An inspection of the data file (brv12387-sup-0001-AppendixS1.xlsx) confirmed that the data was at least nominally relevant to the results reported in the article.

The code (see below) also explicitly mentions that codes requires the data from the Appendix S1 file.

## Code
Section VIII (Supporting information) in the article mentions that Appendix S2 online contains the R code used for the analyses. The code file itself (brv12387-sup-0002-AppendixS2.R) is well structured and documented with comments throughout. It was possible to follow the comments through the code to determine which sections of code needed to be run to obtain the desired model outputs.

# Load packages required by the code to run.
# (These packages are loaded in the same order as loaded in the original code
