## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA062

MA062 refers to the following article:

Grueber, C. E., Gray, L. J., Morris, K. M., Simpson, S. J., & Senior, A. M. (2018). Intergenerational effects of nutrition on immunity: A systematic review and meta-analysis. _Biological Reviews_, _93_(2), 1108â€“1124. https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12387

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `brv12387-sup-0001-appendixs1.xlsx`
- `brv12387-sup-0002-appendixs2.r`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA062.html` in the `output` folder.
