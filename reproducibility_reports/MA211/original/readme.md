## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA211

MA211 refers to the following article:

Yuan, Z. Y., & Chen, H. Y. H. (2015). Negative effects of fertilization on plant nutrient resorption. _Ecology_, _96_(2), 373â€“380. https://doi.org/10.1890/14-0140.1

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `Yuan_and_Chen_data.csv`
- `Yuan_and_Chen_R_codes.R`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA211.html` in the `output` folder.
