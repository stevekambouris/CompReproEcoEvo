## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA016

MA016 refers to the following article:

Xu, X., Medvigy, D., Joseph Wright, S., Kitajima, K., Wu, J., Albert, L. P., Martins, G. A., Saleska, S. R., & Pacala, S. W. (2017). Variations of leaf longevity in tropical moist forests predicted by a trait-driven carbon optimality model. _Ecology Letters_, _20_(9), 1097â€“1106. https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12804

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `BCI_LL_sensitivity.py`
- `BCI_LL_simulation.py`
- `Calculate_Vcmax25.py`
- `ele12804-sup-0003-appendixa2.xlsx`
- `ele12804-sup-0004-appendixs3.xlsx`
- `myForest.py`
- `ReadMe.txt`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA016.html` in the `output` folder.
