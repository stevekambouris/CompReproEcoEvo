## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA092

MA092 refers to the following article:

Xu, X., Medvigy, D., Powers, J. S., Becknell, J. M., & Guan, K. (2016). Diversity in plant hydraulic traits explains seasonal and inter-annual variations of vegetation dynamics in seasonally dry tropical forests. _New Phytologist_, _212_(1), 80â€“95. https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14009

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `nph14009-sup-0002-tables1.xls`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA092.html` in the `output` folder.
