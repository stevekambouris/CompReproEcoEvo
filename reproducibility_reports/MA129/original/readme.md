## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA129

MA129 refers to the following article:

Crouzeilles, R., & Curran, M. (2016). Which landscape size best predicts the influence of forest cover on restoration success? A global meta-analysis on the scale of effect. _Journal of Applied Ecology_, _53_(2), 440â€“448. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12590

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `Biomass_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Biomass_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Birds_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Birds_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Cover_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Cover_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Density_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Density_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Height_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Height_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Herpeto_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Herpeto_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Invertebrates_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Invertebrates_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Litter_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Litter_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Mammals_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Mammals_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Plants_Contiguous_forest_areas.txt`
- `Plants_Forest_areas.txt`
- `Script_Contiguous forest areas.R`
- `Script_Forest areas.R`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA129.html` in the `output` folder.
