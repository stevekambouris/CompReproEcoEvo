## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA071

MA071 refers to the following article:

Sievers, M., Hale, R., Parris, K. M., & Swearer, S. E. (2017). Impacts of human‐induced environmental change in wetlands on aquatic animals. _Biological Reviews_, _93_(1), 529–554. https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12358

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `brv12358-sup-0001-appendixs1.xls`
- `brv12358-sup-0002-appendixs2_ms.r`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA071.html` in the `output` folder.
