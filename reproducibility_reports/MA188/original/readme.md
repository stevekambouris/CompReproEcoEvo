## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA188

MA188 refers to the following article:

Senior, A. M., Nakagawa, S., Lihoreau, M., Simpson, S. J., & Raubenheimer, D. (2015). An Overlooked Consequence of Dietary Mixing: A Varied Diet Reduces Interindividual Variance in Fitness. _The American Naturalist_, _186_(5), 649â€“659. https://doi.org/10.1086/683182

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `Code.R`
- `Data.Objects.Rdata`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA188.html` in the `output` folder.
