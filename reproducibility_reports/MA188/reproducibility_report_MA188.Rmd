# Reproducing result from

Senior, A. M., Nakagawa, S., Lihoreau, M., Simpson, S. J., & Raubenheimer, D. (2015). An Overlooked Consequence of Dietary Mixing: A Varied Diet Reduces Interindividual Variance in Fitness. _The American Naturalist_, _186_(5), 649â€“659. https://doi.org/10.1086/683182

# Result to be reproduced

> REMA of lnRR estimated a negative statistically significant effect (REMA est., CI for lnRR = -0.363, -0.408 to -0.318; fig. 2), which exponentiates to a ratio of mean of fitness-related traits on single-food diets to mixed diets of 0.700; that is, mean fitness is 30% lower on single foods. (Senior et al., 2015, p.653)

Earlier on p.653, the article states that there were 818 estimates of lnRR, so the sample size is 818.

```{r orig-result}
orig_result_df <- data.frame(ID = "MA188",
                             source = "original",
                             result_type = "mean",
                             es_type = "Log response ratio",
                             point_est = -0.363,
                             ci_lower = -0.408,
                             ci_upper = -0.318,

# Details of shared data and code files

The following data and code files were shared on Dryad:

Senior, A. M., Nakagawa, S., Lihoreau, M., Simpson, S. J., & Raubenheimer, D. (2015). _Data from: An overlooked consequence of dietary mixing: A varied diet reduces interindividual variance in fitness._ Dryad Digital Repository. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9hc76

* Code.R
* Data.Objects.Rdata

# Applicability of shared data and code files

## Data
The usage notes on the Dryad repository web page make things very clear: there is only one data file (`Data.Objects.Rdata`) which contains all data relevant to the article analyses. Further, the usage notes mention that the code file `Code.R` contains comments/instructions about accessing the data. The code file does contain a codebook describing all the components within the data file, as well as an additional codebook describing the columns found in the "main" data component `Effect.Sizes`.

## Code
The usage notes on the Dryad repository web page are very straightforward: the file `Code.R` contains all code to recreate the analyses in the article. The code file is extensively documented throughout with comments which makes identifying the relevant sections of code to execute straightforward.

# Set up
```{r library}

# Load packages required for working with original files.
library(here)

# Load custom package for (i) running the source command for specific line
# numbers within a file and (ii) for calculating the percentage error between
# the original and reproduced values.
library(reprohelper)

# Load packages required for data import/cleaning.
# (None required.)

# Load packages required by the code to run.
# (These packages are loaded in the same order as loaded in the original code
# file.)
library("metafor")
library("MCMCglmm")

# Set the path to the original code file(s).

# Import and clean data
```{r importdata}
