## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# Original data and code files required in folder `original` for MA202

MA202 refers to the following article:

Mehrabi, Z., & Tuck, S. L. (2015). Relatedness is a poor predictor of negative plant–soil feedbacks. _New Phytologist_, _205_(3), 1071–1075. https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.13238

This folder needs to contain the following original shared data and code files, at least some of which are used by the reproducibility report to reproduce the target results:

- `nph13238-sup-0001-tables1.xlsx`
- `nph13238-sup-0004-notess2.r`

The details of where these files were found and precisely which are required are detailed in the reproducibility report `reproducibility_report_MA202.html` in the `output` folder.
