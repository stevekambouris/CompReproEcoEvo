## Computationally reproducing results from meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology using shared code and data

# External data file from Culina et al. (2020) required

The analysis script `02_analysis_06_journal_policy_table.R` requires two data files from other articles.

These files have not be included in this repository, and must be downloaded separately in order to re-run analysis script `02_analysis_06_journal_policy_table.R`.

The required data file for this folder is as follows:

- `data/raw/journal_policies_culina_2020/Updated_Table_Mislan_2020_v2.xlsx`

The file `Updated_Table_Mislan_2020_v2.xlsx` is from Culina et al. (2020), and is available at the article's [Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3833928).
