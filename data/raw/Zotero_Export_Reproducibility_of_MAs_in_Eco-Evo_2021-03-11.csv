However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25% of the total trait variation within communities and 32% of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.","2015-12-01","2017-12-20 04:39:20","2018-02-22 04:07:43","2017-12-20 04:39:20","1406-1419","","12","18","","Ecol Lett","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 186","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UFPI6MFI\ele12508-sup-0001-TableS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GXVKCCRG\ele12508-sup-0002-TableS2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P9TWZNGR\ele12508-sup-0003-TableS3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9ALVA4YS\ele12508-sup-0004-AppendixS1.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RVX76EAD\ele12508-sup-0005-AppendixS2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8SLBEFGQ\ele12508-sup-0006-AppendixS3.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ETYD6GT4\ele12508-sup-0007-AppendixS4.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PJEZDK9A\Siefert et al. - 2015 - A global meta-analysis of the relative extent of i.pdf","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","community ecology; functional diversity; interspecific variation; intraspecific variability; leaf trait; plant functional trait; trait-based ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effectiveness of retention approaches with regard to landscape composition remains unexplored. * We linked the effect sizes from two meta-analyses (31 case studies and 1050 comparisons from boreal and temperate regions), which quantified the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation as a result of retention practices, with the stand property of retention level (the percentage of trees retained after logging) and with Landsat-retrieved landscape data on forest cover and spatial configurations at three spatial scales (1, 3, and 5 km radii). * We found that, in addition to the fundamental importance of tree retention as a local-scale implementation for conservation, landscape properties were important in models to predict biodiversity responses. The effect sizes for species richness decreased with increasing patch contiguity within the landscapes at all spatial scales. Similar results were observed for abundance responses at the largest spatial scale. These results suggest that biodiversity responses to tree retention may be weaker in less fragmented landscapes, which is in agreement with theoretical and empirical findings from agricultural landscapes (‘the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis’). * The benefits of retention levels within a stand (percentage of trees retained) varied amongst species with different habitat requirements (forest-dependent, open habitat, and generalist species). Whilst this stand-level property was often an important determinant of biodiversity responses, models that included landscape properties as explanatory variables always performed better than those that were only based on the retention levels for all species groups. Thus, within-stand habitat conditions and landscape configurations likely have synergetic influences on biodiversity responses. * Synthesis and applications. In addition to the importance of stand-level properties, such as the action of retention harvesting itself and the number of trees retained, conditions in the surrounding landscape can simultaneously affect biodiversity in stands that are managed under retention forestry. Our study suggests that retention patches are particularly important in moderately fragmented landscapes. Retention practices could be less important in previously unlogged and less fragmented landscapes, where setting aside large reserves is a conservation priority. For highly fragmented landscapes, different actions of forest restoration, which are not limited to set-aside actions during logging, would be important. Our study emphasizes that carefully planned conservation schemes with a large-scale perspective, as well as local-scale actions, such as retention forestry, are critical for effective forest management and conservation planning.","2017-12-01","2017-12-20 04:53:22","2018-02-22 04:12:18","2017-12-20 04:53:22","1627-1637","","6","54","","J Appl Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 003","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4N5KIXXX\Mori et al. - 2017 - Landscape properties affect biodiversity response .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VS5KQQWB\jpe12888-sup-0001-tables1.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2XU2CN4A\jpe12888-sup-0002-supinfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K6BVY7BR\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; biodiversity; forest certification; habitat fragmentation; land-sharing; landownership; landscape heterogeneity; nature-oriented forestry; retention forestry; set-aside action","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under drought conditions, stomatal control of transpiration has long been thought to be closely coordinated with the decrease in hydraulic capacity (hydraulic failure due to xylem embolism). We tested this hypothesis by coupling a meta-analysis of functional traits related to the stomatal response to drought and embolism resistance with simulations from a soil–plant hydraulic model. We report here a previously unreported phenomenon: the existence of an absolute limit by which stomata closure must occur to avoid rapid death in drought conditions. The water potential causing stomatal closure and the xylem pressure at the onset of embolism formation were equal for only a small number of species, and the difference between these two traits (i.e. safety margins) increased continuously with increasing embolism resistance. Our findings demonstrate the need to revise current views about the functional coordination between stomata and hydraulic traits and provide a mechanistic framework for modeling plant mortality under drought conditions.","2017-11-01","2017-12-20 04:57:22","2018-02-22 04:12:10","2017-12-20 04:57:22","1437-1447","","11","20","","Ecol Lett","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 006","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DER662UP\DataBase.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J8FWKIRS\ele12851-sup-0001-AppendixS1.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QPJV8AKZ\ele12851-sup-0002-AppendixS2.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HFSYS96F\ele12851-sup-0003-AppendixS3.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W39YNRW4\ele12851-sup-0004-AppendixS4.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RR92VIG3\ele12851-sup-0005-Supinfo.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Z2IDWTY4\Martin-StPaul et al. - 2017 - Plant resistance to drought depends on timely stom.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I2EIM739\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","Dieback; drought; stomata; tree mortality; xylem embolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a meta-analysis of 49 species across temperate and tropical biomes, demonstrating that the ageing rate of photosynthetic capacity is positively correlated with the mass-based carboxylation rate of mature leaves. We assess an improved trait-driven carbon optimality model with in situLL data for 105 species in two Panamanian forests.

Both these costly behaviors are assumed to reduce the risk and/or intensity of sperm competition. However, despite many studies on avian extra-pair paternity, it remains unclear how strongly these behaviors are related to fitness and other key life-history traits. Here, we conduct meta-analyses to address two questions. First, are mate guarding and/or frequent copulation positively correlated with a male's share of paternity at his nest? We find a significant positive correlation between both presumed paternity protection behaviors and paternity share. The relationship is, however, weak (r = 0.08–0.23). This is perhaps unsurprising if the risk of partner infidelity, hence the need to protect paternity, varies among males. For example, more attractive males might have less need to protect their paternity. Second, do males with higher indices of so-called male “quality” (phenotypic measures, usually subjectively defined by researchers as predictors of male attractiveness) exhibit lower levels of paternity protection behavior? We find a negative correlation between male quality and paternity protection. This finding might partly explain the weak relationship between paternity protection and paternity, although we discuss other, nonmutually exclusive possibilities.","2016-12-01","2017-12-20 05:38:15","2018-02-22 04:09:49","2017-12-20 05:38:15","2789-2808","","12","70","","Evolution","Mate guarding and frequent copulation in birds","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 074","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\24UQFYIK\Ericson.tre; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JEDT2D6C\evo13081-sup-0001-tables1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K6XBPFGC\evo13081-sup-0002-figs1-s4tables2-s7.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IF74XCMF\Harts et al. - 2016 - Mate guarding and frequent copulation in birds A .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RJPI2QTK\Hackett.tre; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\E2E88ZFG\Q1 standard and multilevel.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4YZYSW9A\Q1All.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\44KEMFE9\Q1Cat.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TTV7DDYG\Q1phylo.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MHXJF9E5\Q2 standard and multilevel.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V2CFZBMK\Q2All.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\87E4M5TS\Q2Cat.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GLQLJHIG\Q2phylo.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2752265M\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; quality; Copulation; guard; paternity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In insects, females are usually the larger and more plastic sex. However, the shortage of taxa with male-biased SSD hampers the assessment of whether the greater plasticity in females is driven by selection on size or represents an effect of the female reproductive role. Here, we specifically address the role of sex-specific plasticity of body size in the evolution of SSD reversals to disentangle sex and size effects. * We first investigate sex-specific body size plasticity in Sepsis punctum and Sepsis neocynipsea as two independent cases of intraspecific SSD reversals in sepsid flies. In both species, directional variation in SSD between populations is driven by stronger sexual selection on male size. Using controlled laboratory breeding, we find evidence for sex-specific plasticity and increased condition dependence of male size in populations with male-biased SSD, but not of female size in populations with female-biased SSD. * To extend the comparative scope, we next estimate sex-specific body size plasticity in eight additional fly species that differ in the direction of SSD under laboratory conditions. In all species with male-biased SSD we find males to be the more plastic sex, while this was only rarely the case in species with female-biased SSD, thus suggesting a more general trend in Diptera. * To examine the generality of this pattern in holometabolous insects, we combine our data with data from the literature in a meta-analysis. Again, male body size tends to be more plastic than female size when males are the larger sex, though female size is now also generally more plastic when females are larger. * Our findings indicate that primarily selection on size, rather than the reproductive role per se, drives the evolution of sex-specific body size plasticity. However, sepsid flies, and possibly Diptera in general, show a clear sexual asymmetry with greater male than female plasticity related to SSD, likely driven by strong sexual selection on males. Although further research controlling for phylogenetic and ecological confounding effects is needed, our findings are congruent with theory in suggesting that condition dependence plays a pivotal role in the evolution of sexual size dimorphism.

We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies (> 500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate).

To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling, sapling and adult. * Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages. Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants. Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings, seedlings and adults, respectively. * Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions, major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in the possibility that this cost of reproduction is mediated by oxidative stress. However, empirical tests of this theory have yielded equivocal support. We carried out a meta-analysis to examine associations between reproduction and oxidative damage across markers and tissues. We show that oxidative damage is positively associated with reproductive effort across females of various species. Yet paradoxically, categorical comparisons of breeders versus non-breeders reveal that transition to the reproductive state is associated with a step-change reduction in oxidative damage in certain tissues and markers. Developing offspring may be particularly sensitive to harm caused by oxidative damage in mothers. Therefore, such reductions could potentially function to shield reproducing mothers, gametes and developing offspring from oxidative insults that inevitably increase as a consequence of reproductive effort. According to this perspective, we hypothesise that the cost of reproduction is mediated by dual impacts of maternally-derived oxidative damage on mothers and offspring, and that mothers may be selected to diminish such damage. Such oxidative shielding may explain why many existing studies have concluded that reproduction has little or no oxidative cost. Future advance in life-history theory therefore needs to take account of potential transgenerational impacts of the mechanisms underlying life-history trade-offs.","2016-05-01","2018-01-01 06:22:14","2018-02-22 04:08:46","2018-01-01 06:22:14","483-497","","2","91","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 120","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AKR3EWKK\brv12179-sup-0001-FileS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6VNCF4B2\Blount et al. - 2016 - Oxidative shielding and the cost of reproduction.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NZVTNSFG\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","ageing; fetal programming; life-history trade-off; oxidative shielding hypothesis; oxidative stress; reactive oxygen species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exaggerated swellings are typically largest around the time of ovulation, and swelling size has been reported to correlate positively with female quality, supporting the hypothesis that exaggerated swellings are honest signals of both female fecundity and quality. However, the relationship between swelling size and timing of ovulation is weak in some studies, and the relationship between swelling size and female quality has also not been consistently reported. Here, we collated empirical studies that have reported either swelling size and estimated timing of ovulation (N=26) or swelling size and measures of individual quality (N=7), to assess the strength of these relationships using meta-analytical methods. Our analyses confirmed that the period of maximal swelling size is closely associated with the most fertile period of the ovarian cycle and that a large proportion of ovulations occur during the maximal swelling period. A small, positive effect size was also found for the relationship between swelling size and body condition. In contrast, the relationships with age and social rank were not significant. Swelling size, therefore, potentially signals both female condition and timing of the fertile phase. Males are likely to benefit from allocating mating effort according to swelling size, while females with large swellings potentially benefit from exerting control over matings in species in which female control is compromised by male mating strategies.","2016-02-01","2018-01-01 06:23:44","2018-02-22 04:10:58","2018-01-01 06:23:43","203-212","","Supplement C","112","","Animal Behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 140","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HTKH9ATI\1-s2.0-S0003347215004364-mmc1.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SF9SBS9Q\1-s2.0-S0003347215004364-main.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RUQXJ6MT\S0003347215004364.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","quality; graded signal; ornament; ovulation; reliable indicator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The strength of these effects is spatiotemporally variable, and several sets of authors have suggested that they are governed in part by primary productivity. However, prior theoretical and field studies have generated conflicting results and predictions, underscoring the need for a synthetic global analysis. * We conducted a meta-analysis of the direction and magnitude of large mammalian herbivore-initiated indirect interactions using 67 published studies comprising 456 individual responses. We georeferenced 41 of these studies (comprising 253 responses from 33 locations on five continents) to a satellite-derived map of primary productivity. Because predator assemblages might also influence the impact of large herbivores, we conducted a similar analysis using a global map of large carnivore species richness. * In general, LMH reduced the abundance of other consumer species and also tended to reduce consumer richness, although the latter effect was only marginally significant. * There was a pronounced reduction in the strength of negative (i.e. suppressive, due e.g., to competition) indirect effects of LMH on consumer abundance in more productive ecosystems. In contrast, positive (facilitative) indirect effects were not significantly correlated with productivity, likely because these comprised a more heterogeneous array of mechanisms. We found no effect of carnivore species richness on herbivore-initiated indirect effect strength. * Our findings help to resolve the fundamental problem of ecological contingency as it pertains to the strength of an understudied class of multitrophic interactions. Moreover, these results will aid in predicting the indirect effects of anthropogenic wildlife declines and irruptions, and how these effects might be mediated by climatically driven shifts in resource availability. To the extent that intact ungulate guilds help to suppress populations of small animals that act as agricultural pests and disease reservoirs, the negative impacts of large mammal declines on human well-being may be relatively stronger in low-productivity areas.","2016-07-01","2018-01-01 06:26:25","2018-02-22 04:09:13","2018-01-01 06:26:25","857-868","","4","85","","J Anim Ecol","Does primary productivity modulate the indirect effects of large herbivores?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 149","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NLFRPQLW\DaskinRawData_160225.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\T7VAFMQ9\Daskin and Pringle - 2016 - Does primary productivity modulate the indirect ef.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KD72RNL7\jane12522-sup-0001-Suppinfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6RG2AV4U\jane12522-sup-0002-Suppinfo.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RS3B2RH9\jane12522-sup-0003-Suppinfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QW7P6H8E\jane12522-sup-0004-Suppinfo.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QTK5NIAY\README.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WLPA5RDY\abstract.html; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\49PZMA2T\SpatialWeightsMatrix_151224.csv","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","competition; context dependence; ecosystem engineers; large mammals; trophic cascades; ungulate herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We define 20 grouped variables of agriculture's impact (e.g. on soil, greenhouse gas, water, biodiversity) and find evidence of both strong positive and negative correlations between them. Analysis based on the efficiency frontier suggests that trade-offs can be ‘softened’ by exploiting the natural between-study variation that arises from a combination of farming best practice and context.

The analysis investigates the issues of stigma and microaggressions and their effects on Black African communities. Background Previous work that investigated experiences of stigma faced by relatively early Black African new settlers to New Zealand found that new settlers experienced stigma, and their resulting isolation had negative implications for access to health and social services, regardless of HIV status. Design This paper is a meta-analysis of two published studies, using original qualitative data from each. Methods Researchers for the first study, Standing in the Fire, interviewed 13 Black Africans living with HIV who were new settlers to New Zealand. The second study, AfricaNZ Care, was a national mixed method study which surveyed 703 Black African new settlers, and included 131 participants in 23 different focus groups. The present analysis includes only the qualitative data from the second study. Some, but not most, participants of the second study were living with HIV. Results Black African identity is used as a proxy for HIV status among non-HIV specialist health care workers. Participants reported experiences of stigma and microaggressions based on their race, and a lack of knowledge about HIV in non-HIV specialist nurses and other health care workers. They also experienced poor health care and education practices, professional prejudice against colleagues living with HIV and institutional challenges including failure to protect patient confidentiality. Conclusions HIV-related stigma and microaggressions remain significant problems, not only for people living with HIV but also for those perceived to be at high risk for HIV. Relevance to clinical practice Experiences of stigmatising behaviour by health care professionals have a broad and significant range of impacts on patients’ health outcomes.","2016-07-01","2018-01-01 06:29:57","2018-02-22 04:14:56","2018-01-01 06:29:57","1941-1949","","13-14","25","","J Clin Nurs","‘Treating Africans differently’","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 154","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5HYZHWKB\Henrickson and Fisher - 2016 - ‘Treating Africans differently’ using skin colour.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FJVA7UUJ\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Other","African Diaspora; AIDS/HIV; Black African; microaggressions; race; stigma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, factors triggering female mating decisions and potential fitness benefits from extrapair matings still remain poorly understood. Some studies suggest that females mate socially with low-quality males but seek extrapair mates offering superior genes for their progeny. This mating strategy may also help in mitigating the potential negative effects of pairing with a genetically similar mate. Here, we investigate whether genetic similarity within a social pair may predict the occurrence of extrapair paternity (EPP) in birds. Using a meta-analytical approach to a number of studies performed on birds, we found a positive relationship between the occurrence of EPP and the relatedness of social mates. Moreover, we found that the type of molecular markers used to estimate relatedness significantly affected the observed effect size. Specifically, we showed that only microsatellite markers were associated with significantly positive effect sizes. Thus, failure of some of the previous studies to detect the relationship between occurrence of EPP and the relatedness of social mates may at least partly arise due to methodological reasons.","2015-07-01","2018-01-01 06:33:55","2018-02-22 03:29:05","2018-01-01 06:33:55","959-968","","4","26","","Behav Ecol","","","","","","","","","","","","","academic-oup-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 183","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9QDXRG7S\Arct et al. - 2015 - Genetic similarity between mates predicts extrapai.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I2KT57IL\209117.html; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XYGZHNGA\subm_rev_SI.docx","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A recent synthesis addressing this issue found conflicting evidence for the relationship between diet breadth and mean individual fitness. Specifically, it found that while, on average, a mixed diet does increase mean fitness, in some instances, a single food provides equal (or higher) fitness than a mixed diet. Critical to ecological and evolutionary considerations of diet, however, is not only mean fitness but also variance in fitness. We combine contemporary meta-analytic methods with models of nutritional geometry to evaluate how diet affects between-individual variance in fitness within generalist consumers from a range of trophic levels. As predicted by nutritional geometry, we found that between-individual variance in fitness-related traits is higher on single-food than mixed diets. The effect was strong for longevity traits (57% higher) and reproductive traits (37%) and present but weaker for size-related traits (10%). Further, the effect became stronger as the number of available foods increased. The availability of multiple foods likely allows individuals with differing nutritional optima to customize intake, each maximizing their own fitness. Importantly, these findings may suggest that selection on traits correlated with nutritional requirements is weak in heterogeneous nutritional environments.","2015-11-01","2018-01-01 06:35:38","2018-02-22 04:07:30","2018-01-01 06:35:38","649-659","","5","186","","The American Naturalist","An Overlooked Consequence of Dietary Mixing","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 188","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PRYZUCRP\56196apa.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C7HB2K3U\Code.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SVHNBYJ2\Data.Objects.Rdata; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RMWE9M7V\Senior et al. - 2015 - An Overlooked Consequence of Dietary Mixing A Var.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GUM9LFHH\683182.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review and synthesize the results of these papers. Studies reveal levels of genetic diversity comparable to shallow-water species. Generally, populations at similar depths were well connected over 100s–1,000s km, but studies that sampled across depth ranges reveal population structure at much smaller scales (100s–1,000s m) consistent with isolation by adaptation across environmental gradients, or the existence of physical barriers to connectivity with depth. Few studies were ocean-wide (under 4%), and 48% were Atlantic-focused. There is strong emphasis on megafauna and commercial species with research into meiofauna, “ecosystem engineers” and other ecologically important species lacking. Only nine papers account for ~50% of the planet's surface (depths below 3,500 m). Just two species were studied below 5,000 m, a quarter of Earth's seafloor. Most studies used single-locus mitochondrial genes revealing a common pattern of non-neutrality, consistent with demographic instability or selective sweeps; similar to deep-sea hydrothermal vent fauna. The absence of a clear difference between vent and non-vent could signify that demographic instability is common in the deep sea, or that selective sweeps render single-locus mitochondrial studies demographically uninformative. The number of population genetics studies to date is miniscule in relation to the size of the deep sea. The paucity of studies constrains meta-analyses where broad inferences about deep-sea ecology could be made.","2017-10-01","2018-01-04 05:04:53","2018-02-22 04:16:23","2018-01-04 05:04:53","4872-4896","","19","26","","Mol Ecol","Invertebrate population genetics across Earth's largest habitat","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 012","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JWP3IR32\Taylor and Roterman - 2017 - Invertebrate population genetics across Earth's la.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VZXUFGYU\mec14237-sup-0001-SupInfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JLLBY3TZ\abstract;jsessionid=B64DE7D37F38D9111ED830BC9EEC0CD8.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Other Review","benthic; deep sea; genetic connectivity; marine; population genomics; vulnerable marine ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, in some situations, the outcome of mutualisms can move from beneficial to detrimental for at least one partner. In the case of protective mutualisms between ant bodyguards and plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), plants from arid environments face a trade-off between EFN production and maintenance and water and carbon economy. This trade-off may increase EFN costs and decrease their value as a defensive strategy to plants in such environments. Despite this, the presence of EFNs is an ubiquitous trait in plants from arid environments, suggesting that they provide greater benefits to plants in these environments to compensate for their higher costs. We used a meta-analysis to investigate if such benefits do increase with decreasing water availability and the possible underlying causes (such as ant behaviour or ant diversity). As predicted, ant effect on EFN plants performance increased as mean annual precipitation decreased. We also found that the frequency of dominant ants on EFN plants increased in drier areas. Due to the more aggressive behaviour of dominant ants, we suggest that they represent an important factor shaping the adaptive value of EFNs to plants in arid environments.","2017-08-01","2018-01-04 05:05:55","2018-02-22 04:11:58","2018-01-04 05:05:55","1785-1794","","3","92","","Biol Rev","Decreasing water availability across the globe improves the effectiveness of protective ant–plant mutualisms","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 020","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Z5JZD9MP\brv12307-sup-0001-AppendixS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KSYVV8C4\Leal and Peixoto - 2017 - Decreasing water availability across the globe imp.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4R3FMWY2\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","anti-herbivore defence; coevolutionary mosaics; context-dependence; extrafloral nectar; facultative mutualism; partner identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In cases where multiple defenses confer protection by independent means (i.e. they are mechanistically independent) responses will either be co-expressed, or the expression of one defense will limit the capacity (or need) to respond along another axis. Our ability to generate a broad understanding of these patters has been limited, in part, by difficulties in comparing results across studies that employ distinct experimental protocols. Using the extensive literature on tadpole responses to PPR, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the ecological and experimental determinants of inducible defence expression. We then assessed whether the magnitude of response to PPR along behavioural versus morphological response axes was positively, or negatively, correlated. The most commonly quantified responses to perceived risk in tadpoles included reductions in movement and swimming behaviour, and altered tail morphology. Our analyses reveal that tadpole behavioural responses are strongly influenced by prey family, predator taxon, evolutionary history with the predator (native versus non-native), amount of prey consumed by the predator, and how perceived risk was manipulated (e.g. presence versus absence of alarm cues). Tail morphology was similarly influenced by these factors, but also whether the target prey was palatable to predators. Thus, our results identify ecological and experimental features that critically influence the observed effect size in tadpole responses to PPR. A positive correlation between behavioural and morphological responses in studies where both were measured indicates that trait co-specialization is the predominant pattern of defense deployment in larval amphibians. This positive relationship suggests that survival tends to be maximized in tadpoles through equivalent co-activation of multiple independent axes of protection, opposed to maximal expression along any single axis.  Synthesis Our understanding of plastic responses to perceived predation risk (PPR) has benefited substantially from the vast amount of experimental work examining inducible defences in anuran tadpoles. Indeed this research has illustrated the wide variety of ways that prey animals can respond to the same risk event. We conducted a metaanalysis to identify the key ecological and experimental determinants of inducible defence expression. We then show that, in most cases, behavioural and morphological responses to PPR tend to be co-expressed suggesting that responding along one axis (moving behaviour) does not limit their ability to respond along another distinct axis (tail morphology).","2017-02-01","2018-01-04 05:07:56","2018-02-22 04:11:35","2018-01-04 05:07:56","n/a-n/a","","2","126","","Oikos","Determinants and co-expression of anti-predator responses in amphibian tadpoles","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 048","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NLM26285\Hossie et al. - 2017 - Determinants and co-expression of anti-predator re.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Y529WEIH\Hossie et al 2016 OIKOS - Dataset.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\742IGVZP\oik-03305_0.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S3R2KI2D\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focused our analyses on the most diverse group of primary consumers, herbivorous insects, and found that in general top-down forces were stronger than bottom-up forces. Notably, chewing, sucking and gall-making herbivores were more affected by top-down than bottom-up forces, top-down forces were stronger than bottom-up in both natural and controlled (cultivated) environments, and parasitoids and predators had equally strong top-down effects on insect herbivores.

These habitats are subject to anthropogenic pressures, of which eutrophication is one major stressor. Eutrophication favours fast-growing ephemeral algae over perennial macroalgae and seagrasses, causing habitat degradation. However, changes in top-down control, caused by, for example, overfishing, may also have negative impacts on such habitats by decreasing grazer control of ephemeral algae. Meanwhile, systematic analyses estimating top-down effects of predator manipulations across a wide range of studies are missing, limiting the potential use of top-down control measures in coastal management. * Here, we review the literature on experiments that test top-down and bottom-up controls in seagrass Zostera marina and seaweed Fucus spp. food webs in the North Atlantic. Using meta-analysis and meta-regression, we compare effect sizes of consumer and nutrient manipulations on primary producers, grazers and mesopredators. * Presence of mesopredators on average doubled the biomass of ephemeral algae through trophic cascades, mainly mediated via negative effects on amphipods and isopods. Of the grazers, gastropods had twice as strong a negative effect on ephemeral algae as amphipods/isopods, but responded weakly to both predators and fertilization. In accordance with theory, top-down effects became stronger with eutrophication. * Across studies, top-down effects on ephemeral algae at all trophic levels are on par with eutrophication effects. However, the few studies manipulating piscivorous fish make estimates of their top-down effects uncertain. * Synthesis and applications. Consistently strong top-down effects in coastal ecosystems call for an integrated ecosystem perspective.

These changes are increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global literature review on the impact of three of the most important disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of the boreal, cool- and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i) synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services (P < 0.001). Indicators of biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by disturbance (P < 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a ‘disturbance paradox’, documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance. While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total ecosystem carbon by 38.5% (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by 35.6%. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed.","2016-08-01","2018-01-04 05:19:12","2018-02-22 04:11:08","2018-01-04 05:19:12","760-781","","3","91","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 107","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SM7S67BZ\brv12193-sup-0001-figs1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UWUUWLNB\brv12193-sup-0002-appendixs1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XBBDPLIS\brv12193-sup-0003-appendixs2.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\U8WD67BG\Thom and Seidl - 2016 - Natural disturbance impacts on ecosystem services .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D7HVLMDE\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","forest management; biodiversity; ecosystem services; bark beetles; disturbance effect; disturbance paradox; fire; prescribed burning; salvage logging; wind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Invasive plants have been shown to reduce pollinator visitation to natives and increase pollen quantity limitation. However, visitation and conspecific pollen delivery are the only two components of the pollination process; post-pollination interactions on the stigma (heterospecific pollen [HP] receipt) could intensify pre-pollination responses to invasion. * Here, we used meta-analysis to test the hypotheses that invasive plants are more detrimental as HP donors than natives ones and that HP donors that are closely related to the recipients have stronger effects on fruit and seed production compared to distantly related ones. * Invasive HP donors reduced fruit and seed production of recipients to a greater degree than native ones, and this was more intense for HP donors closely related to natives. Related donors were more detrimental overall. * Synthesis. These results suggest that the total effect of invasive plants on native plant reproductive success could be greater than what is inferred from visitation and conspecific pollen transfer alone. Furthermore, these results indicate that invasive species can reduce reproductive success of native species even if pollinator visitation rates remain unaltered.

Under a more relaxed conception, it is argued that ecological laws emerge at the level of communities and elsewhere. A brief review of this debate reveals an issue with deep philosophical roots that is unlikely to be resolved by a better understanding of generalizations in ecology. We therefore propose a strategy for transforming the conceptual question about the nature of ecological laws into a set of empirically tractable hypotheses about the relative resilience of ecological generalizations across three dimensions: taxonomy, habitat type, and scale. These hypotheses are tested using a survey of 240 meta-analyses in ecology. Our central finding is that generalizations in community ecology are just as prevalent and as resilient as those in population or ecosystem ecology. These findings should help to establish community ecology as a generality-seeking science as opposed to a science of case studies. It also supports the capacity for ecologists, working at any of the three levels, to inform matters of public policy.","2016-05-24","2018-01-04 05:29:58","2018-02-22 04:22:54","2018-01-04 05:29:58","119-131","","2","91","","The Quarterly Review of Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 114","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QJ9U76CK\document.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UBB3Q86W\686809.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Theoretical/Methodological","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the recent proliferation of small-scale studies on herbivore effects on aquatic plants, there remains limited understanding of the factors that control consumer regulation of vascular plants in aquatic ecosystems. Our current knowledge of the regulation of primary producers has hindered efforts to understand the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and to manage such ecosystems effectively. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the outcomes of plant–herbivore interactions using a data set comprised of 326 values from 163 studies, in order to test two mechanistic hypotheses: first, that greater negative changes in plant abundance would be associated with higher herbivore biomass densities; second, that the magnitude of changes in plant abundance would vary with herbivore taxonomic identity. We found evidence that plant abundance declined with increased herbivore density, with plants eliminated at high densities. Significant between-taxa differences in impact were detected, with insects associated with smaller reductions in plant abundance than all other taxa. Similarly, birds caused smaller reductions in plant abundance than echinoderms, fish, or molluscs. Furthermore, larger reductions in plant abundance were detected for fish relative to crustaceans. We found a positive relationship between herbivore species richness and change in plant abundance, with the strongest reductions in plant abundance reported for low herbivore species richness, suggesting that greater herbivore diversity may protect against large reductions in plant abundance. Finally, we found that herbivore–plant nativeness was a key factor affecting the magnitude of herbivore impacts on plant abundance across a wide range of species assemblages. Assemblages comprised of invasive herbivores and native plant assemblages were associated with greater reductions in plant abundance compared with invasive herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and mixed-nativeness plants, and native herbivores and native plants. By contrast, assemblages comprised of native herbivores and invasive plants were associated with lower reductions in plant abundance compared with both mixed-nativeness herbivores and native plants, and native herbivores and native plants. However, the effects of herbivore–plant nativeness on changes in plant abundance were reduced at high herbivore densities. Our mean reductions in aquatic plant abundance are greater than those reported in the literature for terrestrial plants, but lower than aquatic algae. Our findings highlight the need for a substantial shift in how biologists incorporate plant–herbivore interactions into theories of aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning. Currently, the failure to incorporate top-down effects continues to hinder our capacity to understand and manage the ecological dynamics of habitats that contain aquatic plants.","2017-05-01","2018-01-04 05:36:34","2018-02-22 04:12:57","2018-01-04 05:36:34","1128-1141","","2","92","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 157","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TL7BZ46R\brv12272-sup-0001-suppinfo.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VLX2ZHJS\Wood et al. - 2017 - Herbivore regulation of plant abundance in aquatic.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2LYZG5XF\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; density-dependent effects; ecosystem structure and function; exclosure experiments; grazing impact; invasive non-native species; macrophyte standing crop; resource–consumer interactions; trophic interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mating preferences may be tested using either no-choice or choice designs, and these tests may result in different estimates of preference strength. However, previous studies testing for this difference have given mixed results. To quantify the difference in the strength of mating preferences obtained using the 2 designs, we performed a meta-analysis of 38 studies on 40 species in which both experimental designs were used to test for preferences in a single species/trait/sex combination. We found that mating preferences were significantly stronger when tested using a choice design compared with a no-choice design. We suggest that this difference is due to the increased cost of rejecting partners in no-choice tests; if individuals perceive they are unlikely to remate in a no-choice situation they will be more likely to mate randomly. Importantly the use of choice tests in species in which mates are primarily encountered sequentially in the wild may lead to mating preferences being significantly overestimated. Furthermore, this pattern was seen for female mate choice but not for male mate choice, and for intraspecific choice but not for interspecies or interpopulation mate discrimination. Our study thus highlights the fact that the strength of mating preferences, and thus sexual selection, can vary significantly between experimental designs and across different social and ecological contexts.","2015-03-01","2018-01-04 05:38:25","2018-02-22 04:06:23","2018-01-04 05:38:25","311-319","","2","26","","Behav Ecol","The effect of experimental design on the measurement of mate choice","","","","","","","","","","","","academic-oup-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 197","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\G2NZIL2Z\aru125_Supplementary_Data.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VQFUINI8\Dougherty and Shuker - 2015 - The effect of experimental design on the measureme.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\83PAV7I4\257207.html; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BUWT9ZTY\Supplementary_material_all.doc","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to understand how nutrient enrichment affects plant litter decomposition, a key ecosystem-level process in forest streams. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 99 studies published between 1970 and 2012 that reported the effects of nutrient enrichment on litter decomposition in running waters. When considering the entire database, which consisted of 840 case studies, nutrient enrichment stimulated litter decomposition rate by approximately 50%. The stimulation was higher when the background nutrient concentrations were low and the magnitude of the nutrient enrichment was high, suggesting that oligotrophic streams are most vulnerable to nutrient enrichment. The magnitude of the nutrient-enrichment effect on litter decomposition was higher in the laboratory than in the field experiments, suggesting that laboratory experiments overestimate the effect and their results should be interpreted with caution. Among field experiments, effects of nutrient enrichment were smaller in the correlative than in the manipulative experiments since in the former the effects of nutrient enrichment on litter decomposition were likely confounded by other environmental factors, e.g. pollutants other than nutrients commonly found in streams impacted by human activity. However, primary studies addressing the effect of multiple stressors on litter decomposition are still few and thus it was not possible to consider the interaction between factors in this review. In field manipulative experiments, the effect of nutrient enrichment on litter decomposition depended on the scale at which the nutrients were added: stream reach > streamside channel > litter bag. This may have resulted from a more uniform and continuous exposure of microbes and detritivores to nutrient enrichment at the stream-reach scale. By contrast, nutrient enrichment at the litter-bag scale, often by using diffusing substrates, does not provide uniform controllable nutrient release at either temporal or spatial scales, suggesting that this approach should be abandoned. In field manipulative experiments, the addition of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) resulted in stronger stimulation of litter decomposition than the addition of N or P alone, suggesting that there might be nutrient co-limitation of decomposition in streams. The magnitude of the nutrient-enrichment effect on litter decomposition was higher for wood than for leaves, and for low-quality than for high-quality leaves. The effect of nutrient enrichment on litter decomposition may also depend on climate. The tendency for larger effect size in colder regions suggests that patterns of biogeography of invertebrate decomposers may be modulating the effect of nutrient enrichment on litter decomposition. Although studies in temperate environments were overrepresented in our database, our meta-analysis suggests that the effect of nutrient enrichment might be strongest in cold oligotrophic streams that depend on low-quality plant litter inputs.","2015-08-01","2018-01-04 05:39:25","2018-02-22 04:06:36","2018-01-04 05:39:25","669-688","","3","90","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 207","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AEQF6GSI\brv12125-sup-0001-AppendixS1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IERVKUDL\brv12125-sup-0002-FigS1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HWBSZ5TP\brv12125-sup-0003-FigS2.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3C6684X8\brv12125-sup-0004-FigS3.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FLS76P3F\brv12125-sup-0005-TableS1.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PJC3QLDG\brv12125-sup-0006-TableS2.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FKG5EMUC\brv12125-sup-0007-TableS3.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FCAAW763\brv12125-sup-0008-TableS4.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LQWPI43S\brv12125-sup-0009-TableS5.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LL4XFXMU\brv12125-sup-0010-TableS6.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YUM5647C\brv12125-sup-0011-TableS7.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J5G5T64W\brv12125-sup-0012-TableS8.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DF5FRTU3\Ferreira et al. - 2015 - A meta-analysis of the effects of nutrient enrichm.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7EXCU2EM\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","eutrophication; climate; decomposers; detritivores; experimental setting; fungi; inorganic nutrients; litter processing; nutrient addition; plant litter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, meta-analyses suggest that group size only explains a small amount of variation in vigilance, and studies have shown that other social attributes, such as dominance status, also influence perceived risk and time allocated to vigilance. Social network analysis is an emerging technique to quantify a variety of specific social attributes, some of which have been suggested to influence ‘security’. Using the proportion of time looking as an indicator of vigilance and predation risk assessment, we tested the prediction that more socially connected yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer, look less while foraging compared to their less socially connected counterparts. For females and males separately, we used observational data to create intrasexual, weighted social networks. We used principal component analysis to reduce correlated measures to unrelated and independent descriptions of connectedness. Using linear mixed effect models to account for potentially confounding variables, we found that no social network measure explained variation in vigilance. Social group size explained variation in female vigilance after accounting for variation due to vegetation height and date. Foraging group size and vegetation height explained variation in male vigilance. While social network measures themselves were not significant, our results mirror the fact that yellow-bellied marmots live in female-dominated societies and suggest that overall social group size is relatively more important for females than for males. Systematically studying whether and how social factors and intrasexual social relationships influence antipredator behaviour in other animals will create a better understanding of the benefits of sociality.","2017-12-01","2018-01-11 01:02:44","2018-02-22 04:18:19","2018-01-11 01:02:44","79-85","","","134","","Animal Behaviour","Social security","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 004","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YXMCU5KC\1-s2.0-S0003347217303366-main.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DGZBHXNX\S0003347217303366.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Primary Study","antipredator behaviour; security; social attribute; social network; vigilance; yellow-bellied marmot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that this problem may originate from a culture of ‘you can publish if you found a significant effect’. This culture creates a systematic bias against the null hypothesis which renders meta-analyses questionable and may even lead to a situation where hypotheses become difficult to falsify. In order to pinpoint the sources of error and possible solutions, we review current scientific practices with regard to their effect on the probability of drawing a false-positive conclusion. We explain why the proportion of published false-positive findings is expected to increase with (i) decreasing sample size, (ii) increasing pursuit of novelty, (iii) various forms of multiple testing and researcher flexibility, and (iv) incorrect P-values, especially due to unaccounted pseudoreplication, i.e. the non-independence of data points (clustered data). We provide examples showing how statistical pitfalls and psychological traps lead to conclusions that are biased and unreliable, and we show how these mistakes can be avoided. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to a culture of ‘you can publish if your study is rigorous’. To this end, we highlight promising strategies towards making science more objective. Specifically, we enthusiastically encourage scientists to preregister their studies (including a priori hypotheses and complete analysis plans), to blind observers to treatment groups during data collection and analysis, and unconditionally to report all results. Also, we advocate reallocating some efforts away from seeking novelty and discovery and towards replicating important research findings of one's own and of others for the benefit of the scientific community as a whole. We believe these efforts will be aided by a shift in evaluation criteria away from the current system which values metrics of ‘impact’ almost exclusively and towards a system which explicitly values indices of scientific rigour.","2017-11-01","2018-01-11 01:16:21","2018-02-22 04:24:14","2018-01-11 01:16:21","1941-1968","","4","92","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 008","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EE9Q69HC\Forstmeier et al. - 2017 - Detecting and avoiding likely false-positive findi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JU92SM99\abstract;jsessionid=1490BA945C5BA1FEF16A5F3C17AF426D.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Theoretical/Methodological","P-hacking; confirmation bias; preregistration; replication; HARKing; hindsight bias; overfitting; power; researcher degrees of freedom; Type I error","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such an approach relies on the standardized measurement of functional traits that can be applied across taxa and regions. Currently, however, unified methods of trait measurements are lacking for terrestrial arthropods and related macroinvertebrates (terrestrial invertebrates hereafter). * Here, we present a comprehensive review and detailed protocol for a set of 29 traits known to be sensitive to global stressors and to affect ecosystem processes and services. We give recommendations how to measure these traits under standardized conditions across various terrestrial invertebrate taxonomic groups. * We provide considerations and approaches that apply to almost all traits described, such as the selection of species and individuals needed for the measurements, the importance of intraspecific trait variability, how many populations or communities to sample and over which spatial scales. * The approaches outlined here provide a means to improve the reliability and predictive power of functional traits to explain community assembly, species diversity patterns and ecosystem processes and services within and across taxa and trophic levels, allowing comparison of studies and running meta-analyses across regions and ecosystems. * This handbook is a crucial first step towards standardizing trait methodology across the most studied terrestrial invertebrate groups, and the protocols are aimed to balance general applicability and requirements for special cases or particular taxa. Therefore, we envision this handbook as a common platform to which researchers can further provide methodological input for additional special cases.

Nonindependence can affect two major interrelated components of a meta-analysis: (i) the calculation of effect size statistics and (ii) the estimation of overall meta-analytic estimates and their uncertainty. While some solutions to nonindependence exist at the statistical analysis stages, there is little advice on what to do when complex analyses are not possible, or when studies with nonindependent experimental designs exist in the data. Here we argue that exploring the effects of procedural decisions in a meta-analysis (e.g. inclusion of different quality data, choice of effect size) and statistical assumptions (e.g. assuming no phylogenetic covariance) using sensitivity analyses are extremely important in assessing the impact of nonindependence. Sensitivity analyses can provide greater confidence in results and highlight important limitations of empirical work (e.g. impact of study design on overall effects). Despite their importance, sensitivity analyses are seldom applied to problems of nonindependence. To encourage better practice for dealing with nonindependence in meta-analytic studies, we present accessible examples demonstrating the impact that ignoring nonindependence can have on meta-analytic estimates. We also provide pragmatic solutions for dealing with nonindependent study designs, and for analysing dependent effect sizes. Additionally, we offer reporting guidelines that will facilitate disclosure of the sources of nonindependence in meta-analyses, leading to greater transparency and more robust conclusions.","2017-05-01","2018-01-11 01:26:14","2018-02-22 04:24:32","2018-01-11 01:26:14","2410-2425","","9","26","","Mol Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 051","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2KFRT9Z5\Noble et al. - 2017 - Nonindependence and sensitivity analyses in ecolog.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\M7YANVBD\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Theoretical/Methodological","meta-analysis; hierarchical structure; meta-regression; mixed models; multilevel models; quantitative research synthesis; random effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Together with estimating overall effect magnitudes, meta-analyses estimate differences between effect sizes via heterogeneity statistics. It is widely hypothesized that heterogeneity will be present in ecological/evolutionary meta-analyses due to the system-specific nature of biological phenomena. Despite driving recommended best practices, the generality of heterogeneity in ecological data has never been systematically reviewed. We reviewed 700 studies, finding 325 that used formal meta-analysis, of which total heterogeneity was reported in fewer than 40%. We used second-order meta-analysis to collate heterogeneity statistics from 86 studies. Our analysis revealed that the median and mean heterogeneity, expressed as I2, are 84.67% and 91.69%, respectively. These estimates are well above “high” heterogeneity (i.e., 75%), based on widely adopted benchmarks. We encourage reporting heterogeneity in the forms of I2 and the estimated variance components (e.g., τ2) as standard practice. These statistics provide vital insights in to the degree to which effect sizes vary, and provide the statistical support for the exploration of predictors of effect-size magnitude. Along with standard meta-regression techniques that fit moderator variables, multi-level models now allow partitioning of heterogeneity among correlated (e.g., phylogenetic) structures that exist within data.","2016-12-01","2018-01-11 01:30:17","2018-02-22 04:23:40","2018-01-11 01:30:17","3293-3299","","12","97","","Ecology","Heterogeneity in ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 072","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RSTWII3I\Senior et al. - 2016 - Heterogeneity in ecological and evolutionary meta-.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZTQ9T859\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Theoretical/Methodological","effect size; quantitative review; systematic review; meta-regression; Cochran's Q; eco-evolutionary meta-analysis; homogeneity; I2; mixed model; phylogenetic signal/heritability; sampling variance; weighted regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meta-analytic methods that do not account for the process of observing data, which we may refer to as ‘informal meta-analyses’, may have undesirable properties. In some cases, informal meta-analyses may produce results that are unbiased, but do not necessarily make the best possible use of available data. In other cases, unbiased statistical noise in individual reports in the literature can potentially be converted into severe systematic biases in informal meta-analyses. I first present a general description of how failure to account for noise in individual inferences should be expected to lead to biases in some kinds of meta-analysis. In particular, informal meta-analyses of quantities that reflect the dispersion of parameters in nature, for example, the mean absolute value of a quantity, are likely to be generally highly misleading. I then re-analyse three previously published informal meta-analyses, where key inferences were of aspects of the dispersion of values in nature, for example, the mean absolute value of selection gradients. Major biological conclusions in each original informal meta-analysis closely match those that could arise as artefacts due to statistical noise. I present alternative mixed-model-based analyses that are specifically tailored to each situation, but where all analyses may be implemented with widely available open-source software.

Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriate metric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify ‘anchor’ representatives: for α-diversity metrics these are PD (Faith's phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics. The guide outlined herein will help researchers navigate the current jungle of indices.","2017-05-01","2018-01-11 01:41:52","2018-02-22 04:24:43","2018-01-11 01:41:52","698-715","","2","92","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 156","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TUXFASBI\Tucker et al. - 2017 - A guide to phylogenetic metrics for conservation, .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LEKUZG8I\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Theoretical/Methodological","conservation; biodiversity hotspots; biogeography; community assembly; diversity metrics; evolutionary history; phylogenetic diversity; prioritization; range size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given these challenges, I derive and compare two new estimators that help correct this small-sample bias, and update guidelines and diagnostics for assessing when the response ratio is appropriate for ecological meta-analysis.

However, our recent meta-analysis (Pisanski et al., 2014, Animal Behaviour, 95, 89–99) indicated that formants and F0 could explain no more than 10% and 2% of the variance in human height, respectively, controlling for sex and age. Here, we examined whether other voice parameters, many of which are affected by sex hormones, can indicate additional variance in human body size or shape, and whether these relationships differ between the sexes. Using a cross-cultural sample of 700 men and women, we examined relationships among 19 voice parameters (minimum–maximum F0, mean F0, F0 variability, formant-based vocal tract length estimates, shimmer, jitter, harmonics-to-noise ratio) and eight indices of body size or shape (height, weight, body mass index, hip, waist and chest circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio, chest-to-hip ratio). Our results confirm that formant measures explain the most variance in heights and weights of men and women, whereas shimmer, jitter and harmonics-to-noise ratio do not indicate height, weight or body mass index in either sex. In contrast, these perturbation and noise parameters, in addition to F0 range and variability, explained more variance in body shape than did formants or mean F0, particularly among men. Shimmer or jitter explained the most variance in men's hip circumferences (12%) and chest-to-hip ratios (6%), whereas harmonics-to-noise ratio and formants explained the most variance in women's waist-to-hip ratios (11%), and significantly more than in men's waist-to-hip ratios.

To address this goal, we used an ecosystem-level experiment to test predator–prey theory by manipulating prey abundance to determine whether predation was density dependent, density independent, compensatory or depensatory (inversely density dependent) on prey populations. * Understanding the nature of predation is of primary importance in community ecology because it establishes whether predation has little effect on prey abundance (compensatory), whether it promotes coexistence (density dependent) and reduces the equilibrium of prey (density independent) or whether it can be destabilizing (depensatory). * We used theoretical predictions consisting of functional and numerical equations parameterized independently from meta-analyses on wolves (Canis lupus) and moose (Alces alces), but applied to our specific wolf–moose system. Predictions were tested by experimentally reducing moose abundance across 6500 km2 as a novel way of evaluating the nature of predation. * Depensatory predation of wolves on moose was the best explanation of the population dynamic – a mechanism that has been hypothesized to occur but has rarely been evaluated. Adding locally obtained kill rates and numerical estimates to the independent data provided no benefit to model predictions, suggesting that the theory was robust to local variation. * These findings have critical implications for any organism that is preyed upon but that also has, or will be, subject to increased human exploitation or perturbations from environmental change.

However, recent data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales. Here we reanalyze results of these data syntheses and outline why this conclusion is unfounded. First, we show the datasets collated for these syntheses are spatially biased and not representative of the spatial distribution of species richness or the distribution of many primary drivers of biodiversity change. This casts doubt that their results are representative of global patterns. Second, we argue that detecting the trend in local species richness is very difficult with short time series and can lead to biased estimates of change. Reanalyses of the data detected a signal of study duration on biodiversity change, indicating net biodiversity loss is most apparent in studies of longer duration. Third, estimates of species richness change can be biased if species gains during post-disturbance recovery are included without also including species losses that occurred during the disturbance. Net species gains or losses should be assessed with respect to common baselines or reference communities. Ultimately, we need a globally coordinated effort to monitor biodiversity so that we can estimate and attribute human impacts as causes of biodiversity change. A combination of technologies will be needed to produce regularly updated global datasets of local biodiversity change to guide future policy. At this time the conclusion that there is no net change in local species richness is not the consensus state of knowledge.","2016-08-01","2018-01-11 03:41:34","2018-02-22 04:19:52","2018-01-11 03:41:34","1949-1960","","8","97","","Ecology","Estimating local biodiversity change","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 104","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A2XTGAIU\Gonzalez et al. - 2016 - Estimating local biodiversity change a critique o.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\25TD9E2U\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Response to previous MA","meta-analysis; Anthropocene; species richness; time series; baselines; biodiversity monitoring; extinction; invasion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explored how species richness and composition of co-occurring plant, grasshopper, breeding bird and small mammal communities in arid and mesic grasslands changed in response to increasing aridity and fire frequency. In the arid system, grassland and shrubland plant and breeding bird communities were undergoing directional change, whereas grasshopper and small mammal communities were stable. In the mesic system, all communities were undergoing directional change regardless of fire frequency.

This is because male sexually selected traits might correlate with sperm quality if both are sensitive to factors that influence male condition. A recent meta-analysis found little support for this hypothesis, suggesting little or no shared condition dependence. However, we recently reported that in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) inbreeding had detrimental effects both on phenotypic traits and on measures of sperm quality, implying that variation in inbreeding could induce positive covariance between indicator traits and sperm quality. Therefore, we here assess empirically the average strength of correlations between phenotypic traits (courtship rate, beak colour, tarsus length) and measures of sperm quality (proportion of functional sperm, sperm velocity, sperm length) in populations of only outbred individuals and in mixed populations consisting of inbreds (F = 0.25) and outbreds (F = 0). As expected, phenotype sperm-trait correlations were stronger when the population contained a mix of inbred and outbred individuals. We also found unexpected heterogeneity between our two study populations, with correlations being considerably stronger in a domesticated population than in a recently wild-derived population. Correlations ranged from essentially zero among outbred-only wild-derived birds (mean Fisher's Zr ± SE = 0.03 ± 0.10) to moderately strong among domesticated birds of mixed inbreeding status (Zr ± SE = 0.38 ± 0.08).

We provide a global synthesis of consumer control of vegetation in coastal wetlands, where the domineering role of physical factors such as nutrient and salinity, rather than consumers, has been emphasized for decades. Using a data set of 1748 measures of consumer effects reported in 443 experiments/observations on all continents except Antarctica, we examine the generality of consumer control in salt marshes and mangroves globally. Our analyses show that salt marsh herbivores, including insects, snails, crabs, waterfowl, small mammals, and livestock, generally and often strongly suppress plant survival, aboveground biomass, and height, while their effects on plant density, belowground biomass, reproduction, and cover are more variable. These effects occur in forbs, grasses, and shrubs, and in both seedlings and adult plants. Herbivores additionally affect plant nutrient stoichiometry, and mediate plant interactions, though their effects on plant diversity are less consistent. Higher trophic levels also affect plants, as predators facilitate plant growth through trophic cascades that suppress grazer abundance and grazing rate. In mangroves, there are also signs of consumer control, though the relatively few studies available have often focused on mangrove propagules and seedlings rather than adults. Our analyses further reveal that the strength of consumer control is regulated by many physical factors. Nutrient, disturbance, and flooding, for example, amplify the negative effects of herbivores. Along latitudinal gradients, increased temperature enhances the negative effects of ectothermic herbivores, but has no effect on those of endothermic herbivores. Consumer control of coastal plants is also apparent across study methodologies: in field and laboratory settings, in observational studies, in consumer exclusion and addition experiments, in natural and transplanted plants, and in experiments of various durations. The role of consumer control in coastal vegetation worldwide highlights the need to better recognize and theoretically conceptualize both top-down and bottom-up forcing and their interactions in coastal wetlands. Improved understanding and conservation of coastal wetlands will only occur if we incorporate what the science has revealed: trophic feedbacks are an important and pervasive determinant of coastal plant communities.","2016-08-01","2018-01-16 23:31:01","2018-02-22 04:09:59","2018-01-16 23:31:01","278-294","","3","86","","Ecol Monogr","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 103","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DJ2LFGM4\Dataset 1 Coastal wetland consumer effect synthesis All.xls; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3TEJB8PH\Dataset 2 Coastal wetland consumer effect synthesis Competition subset.xls; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\X47FGL2V\Dataset 3 Coastal wetland consumer effect synthesis Environmental factor subset.xls; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V3HKAPV6\ecm1221-sup-0001-AppendixS1.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W3C7XMQA\ecm1221-sup-0002-AppendixS2.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QT4BP3KT\ecm1221-sup-0003-AppendixS3.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RQKICWHX\He and Silliman - 2016 - Consumer control as a common driver of coastal veg.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZCJ579RH\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; climate change; plant–herbivore interactions; coastal wetlands; food webs; global warming; mangroves; predators; salt marsh; top-down control; trophic cascade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A growing number of studies attempt to determine the source–sink status of local populations. As the source–sink concept is commonly used for management decisions in nature conservation, accurate assessment approaches are crucial. Based on a systematic literature review of studies published between 2002 and 2013, we evaluated a priori predictions on methodological and biological factors that may influence the occurrence of source or sink populations. The review yielded 90 assessments from 73 publications that included qualitative and quantitative evidence for either source or sink population(s) for one or multiple species. Overall, sink populations tended to occur more often than source populations. Moreover, the occurrence of source or sink populations differed among taxonomic classes. Sinks were more often found than sources in mammals, while there was a non-significant trend for the opposite to be true for amphibians. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the occurrence of sources was positively related to connectivity of local populations. Our review furthermore highlights that more than 25 years after Pulliam's widely cited publication on ‘sources, sinks, and population regulation’, in-depth assessments of the source–sink status of populations based on combined consideration of demographic parameters such as fecundity, survival, emigration and immigration are still scarce. To increase our understanding of source–sink systems from ecological, evolutionary and conservation-related perspectives, we recommend that forthcoming studies on source–sink dynamics should pay more attention to the study design (i.e. connectivity of study populations) and that the assessment of the source–sink status of local populations is based on λ values calculated from demographic rates.","2016-08-01","2018-01-16 23:39:07","2018-02-22 04:16:02","2018-01-16 23:39:07","782-795","","3","91","","Biol Rev","Empirical evidence for source–sink populations","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 105","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QZP5PMYT\Furrer and Pasinelli - 2016 - Empirical evidence for source–sink populations a .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UG5HRA5N\abstract;jsessionid=D9AFDE2744CAEF798EC6D8599B0B6D2E.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Other Review","meta-analysis; systematic review; conservation; animals; demography; local populations; sink; source","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Variation along the spectrum of intraspecific competition, with contest and scramble competition as endpoints, leads to vastly different responses to population density. Here we investigated the diversity of intraspecific competition among fish species, predicting that functional forms of density-dependent reproduction would be conserved in related taxa. Using a hierarchical model that links stock–recruitment parameters among populations, species, and orders, we found that the strength of overcompensation, and therefore the type of intraspecific competition, is tightly clustered within taxonomic groupings, as species within an order share similar degrees of compensation. Specifically, species within the orders Salmoniformes and Pleuronectiformes exhibited density dependence indicative of scramble competition (overcompensation) while the orders Clupeiformes, Gadiformes, Perciformes, and Scorpaeniformes exhibited dynamics consistent with contest competition (compensation). Maximum potential recruitment also varied among orders, but with less clustering across species. We also tested whether stock–recruitment parameters correlated with maximum body length among species, but found no strong relationship. Our results suggest that much of the variation in the form of density-dependent reproduction among fish species may be predicted taxonomically due to evolved life history traits and reproductive behaviors.","2016-07-01","2018-01-16 23:42:58","2018-02-22 04:17:39","2018-01-16 23:42:58","1724-1734","","7","97","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 113","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FYL6TNXK\Foss-Grant et al. - 2016 - Hierarchical analysis of taxonomic variation in in.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\T3SLIQJF\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Primary Study","meta-analysis; density-dependence; hierarchical model; intraspecific competition; recruitment compensation; Shepherd stock-recruitment model; stock assessment; stock–recruitment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the recognized influence of flexible feeding on the structure and dynamics of food webs, the consequences of these feeding strategies on the actual shape and characteristics of trophic position distributions have received less attention. We proposed and tested several a priori hypotheses to predict the likely effect of niche-dependent (e.g. herbivore, secondary consumer) foraging on the shape and statistical properties of consumer trophic position distributions using natural abundance stable isotope data from a diverse dataset of consumers. We found evidence that the structural characteristics of consumer trophic position distributions varied as a function of trophic niche. Herbivores and tertiary consumers tended to be ‘packed’ closely near their mean trophic position, with few individuals realizing trophic positions markedly higher or lower than the mean. Conversely, secondary consumers often displayed broad trophic position distributions with many individuals dispersed away from the center of the distribution. We examined the effect of applying constant versus dynamic isotope trophic fractionation models and found that both models yielded similar although not identical results. Our findings suggest that trophic level omnivory supports a larger fraction of consumer diet at intermediate trophic positions than at either the lowest or the highest positions in aquatic food webs. These results suggest that vertical trophic niche declines among higher order consumers despite general evidence that the range of potential foraging options (i.e. horizontal trophic niche) tends to increase at higher trophic positions. Although further work is needed to test the generality of these patterns in other ecosystems, proactively examining trophic position distributions and reporting appropriate measures of central tendency (e.g. arithmetic versus geometric means) will increase the accuracy of individual trophic studies as well as the applicability of results for meta-analytical food web models.","2016-04-01","2018-01-16 23:55:48","2018-02-22 04:17:53","2018-01-16 23:55:48","556-565","","4","125","","Oikos","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 131","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MDXV6XVP\Woodland et al. - 2016 - Niche-dependent trophic position distributions amo.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZJCXHW53\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Primary Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this review is to examine whether, how and to what extent invertebrates affect wood decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. Three broad conclusions can be reached from the available literature. First, wood decomposition is largely driven by microbial activity but invertebrates also play a significant role in both temperate and tropical environments. Primary mechanisms include enzymatic digestion (involving both endogenous enzymes and those produced by endo- and ectosymbionts), substrate alteration (tunnelling and fragmentation), biotic interactions and nitrogen fertilization (i.e. promoting nitrogen fixation by endosymbiotic and free-living bacteria). Second, the effects of individual invertebrate taxa or functional groups can be accelerative or inhibitory but the cumulative effect of the entire community is generally to accelerate wood decomposition, at least during the early stages of the process (most studies are limited to the first 2–3 years). Although methodological differences and design limitations preclude meta-analysis, studies aimed at quantifying the contributions of invertebrates to wood decomposition commonly attribute 10–20% of wood loss to these organisms. Finally, some taxa appear to be particularly influential with respect to promoting wood decomposition. These include large wood-boring beetles (Coleoptera) and termites (Termitoidae), especially fungus-farming macrotermitines. The presence or absence of these species may be more consequential than species richness and the influence of invertebrates is likely to vary biogeographically.","2016-02-01","2018-01-16 23:58:58","2018-02-22 04:16:13","2018-01-16 23:58:58","70-85","","1","91","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 141","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XRQXNZTZ\Ulyshen - 2016 - Wood decomposition as influenced by invertebrates.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DXDXMRNN\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Other Review","biodiversity; ecosystem services; arthropods; insects; Isoptera; saproxylic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many tactics can be used to improve the probability of success, but a comprehensive summary of these does not exist. This increases the risk that valuable tactics will be overlooked, and inhibits effective communication. * We assess the diversity of ‘translocation tactics’ used in mammal and bird translocations, by reviewing the IUCN/SSC Guidelines for Reintroduction and other Conservation Translocations, 195 peer-reviewed articles and 73 case studies from the IUCN/SSC Global Reintroduction Perspectives Series. * We recorded descriptions of every technique used to influence the post-release performance of translocated wildlife. We developed the Translocation Tactics Classification System (TTCS) which defines a collection of 30 tactics and organize them into an ecologically relevant framework. We also assess the occurrence of tactics within the Guidelines, the primary literature and the case studies to evaluate how tactics are communicated within these mediums. * Our results indicate that the Guidelines are a valuable resource, but do not exhaustively cover tactics, and that detailed methodological accounts are rarely made publicly accessible. This highlights the need to develop context-specific resources to support the Guidelines, and to develop and exploit mediums that facilitate recording of methodological detail, the tactical rationale behind the design and evaluations of effectiveness. Although some forms of grey literature address this issue, the general lack of information limits the ability to investigate the relationship between tactics and translocation success. * Synthesis and applications. The Translocation Tactics Classification System (TTCS) provides a checklist which ensures that the full diversity of tactics is considered when developing translocation processes.

In turn, PPMR is used to estimate mean food chain length, trophic transfer efficiency and rates of change in abundance with body mass (usually reported as slopes of size spectra) and to calibrate and validate food web models. * When estimating TL, researchers had assumed that fractionation of δ15N (Δδ15N) did not change with TL. However, a recent meta-analysis indicated that this assumption was not as well supported by data as the assumption that Δδ15N scales negatively with the δ15N of prey. * We collated existing fish community δ15N–body size data for the Northeast Atlantic and tropical Western Arabian Sea with new data from the Northeast Pacific. These data were used to estimate TL–body mass relationships and PPMR under constant and scaled Δδ15N assumptions, and to assess how the scaled Δδ15N assumption affects our understanding of the structure of these food webs. * Adoption of the scaled Δδ15N approach markedly reduces the previously reported differences in TL at body mass among fish communities from different regions. With scaled Δδ15N, TL–body mass relationships became more positive and PPMR fell. * Results implied that realized prey size in these size-structured fish communities are less variable than previously assumed and food chains potentially longer. The adoption of generic PPMR estimates for calibration and validation of size-based fish community models is better supported than hitherto assumed, but predicted slopes of community size spectra are more sensitive to a given change or error in realized PPMR when PPMR is small.","2015-11-01","2018-01-17 00:48:40","2018-02-22 04:17:13","2018-01-17 00:48:40","1618-1627","","6","84","","J Anim Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 165","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZW4HV2CX\Reum et al. - 2015 - Implications of scaled δ15N fractionation for comm.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2MH9IWKT\jane12405-sup-0001-TableS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LZ5IWEXF\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Primary Study","body mass; food web; predator–prey; size spectra; transfer efficiency; trophic level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extra-pair paternity (EPP) varies within and across species, but reasons for this variation remain unclear. One possible source of variation is population genetic diversity, which has been shown in interspecific meta-analyses to correlate with EPP but which has limited support from intraspecific tests. Using eight populations of the genetically polyandrous red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), including an island population, we investigated whether population-level differences in genetic diversity led to differences in EPP. We first measured genetic diversity over 10 microsatellite loci and found, as predicted, low genetic diversity in the island population. Additional structure analyses with multilocus genotypes and mtDNA showed the island population to be distinct from the continental populations. However, the island population's EPP rate fell in the middle of the continental populations' distribution, whereas the continental populations themselves showed significant variation in EPP. This result suggests that genetic diversity by itself is not a predictor of EPP rate. We discuss reasons for the departure from previous results, including hypotheses for EPP that do not solely implicate female-driven behaviour.","2015-05-01","2018-01-17 01:07:14","2018-02-22 04:17:00","2018-01-17 01:07:14","1156-1169","","5","28","","J.

We performed a search of scientific articles and identified 160 articles that employed a genetic approach within a restoration context to shed light on the links between genetics and restoration. These articles were then classified on whether they examined association between genetics and fitness or the application of genetics in demographic studies, and on the way the studies informed restoration practice. Although genetic research in restoration is rapidly growing, we found that studies could make better use of the extensive toolbox developed by applied fields in genetics. Overall, 41% of reviewed studies used genetic information to evaluate or monitor restoration, and 59% provided genetic information to guide prerestoration decision-making processes. Reviewed studies suggest that restoration practitioners often overlook the importance of including genetic aspects within their restoration goals.

Empirical studies and meta-analyses of invasibility have produced inconsistent and even conflicting results. This lack of consistency, and subsequent difficulty in making broad cross-habitat comparisons, stem in part from (1) the indiscriminant use of a closely related, but fundamentally different concept, that of degree of invasion (DI) or level of invasion; and (2) the lack of common invasibility metrics, as illustrated by our review of all invasibility-related papers published in 2013. To facilitate both cross-habitat comparison and more robust ecological generalizations, we clarify the definitions of invasibility and DI, and for the first time propose a common metric for quantifying invasibility based on a habitat's resource availability as inferred from relative resident species richness and biomass. We demonstrate the feasibility of our metric using empirical data collected from 2475 plots from three forest ecosystems in the eastern United States. We also propose a similar metric for DI. Our unified, resource-based metrics are scaled from 0 to 1, facilitating cross-habitat comparisons. Our proposed metrics clearly distinguish invasibility and DI from each other, which will help to (1) advance invasion ecology by allowing more robust testing of generalizations and (2) facilitate more effective invasive species control and management.","2015-10-01","2018-01-17 01:10:27","2018-02-22 04:16:52","2018-01-17 01:10:27","2613-2621","","10","96","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 209","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QKJW7TFA\Guo et al. - 2015 - A unified approach for quantifying invasibility an.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TCLE68PP\abstract.html","","competition; abundance; community ecology theory; invasion theory; niche availability; prediction; resources; Scopus Search A: Not MA - Primary Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluate evidence for population differentiation, natural selection and adaptive evolution of invading plants and animals at two nested spatial scales: (i) among introduced populations (ii) between native and introduced genotypes. Evolution during invasion is frequently inferred, but rarely confirmed as adaptive. In common garden studies, quantitative trait differentiation is only marginally lower (~3.5%) among introduced relative to native populations, despite genetic bottlenecks and shorter timescales (i.e. millennia vs. decades). However, differentiation between genotypes from the native vs. introduced range is less clear and confounded by nonrandom geographic sampling; simulations suggest this causes a high false-positive discovery rate (>50%) in geographically structured populations. Selection differentials (¦s¦) are stronger in introduced than in native species, although selection gradients (¦β¦) are not, consistent with introduced species experiencing weaker genetic constraints. This could facilitate rapid adaptation, but evidence is limited. For example, rapid phenotypic evolution often manifests as geographical clines, but simulations demonstrate that nonadaptive trait clines can evolve frequently during colonization (~two-thirds of simulations). Additionally, QST-FST studies may often misrepresent the strength and form of natural selection acting during invasion. Instead, classic approaches in evolutionary ecology (e.g. selection analysis, reciprocal transplant, artificial selection) are necessary to determine the frequency of adaptive evolution during invasion and its influence on establishment, spread and impact of invasive species. These studies are rare but crucial for managing biological invasions in the context of global change.","2015-05-01","2018-01-17 01:11:41","2018-02-22 04:06:08","2018-01-17 01:11:41","1999-2017","","9","24","","Mol Ecol","Contemporary evolution during invasion","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 213","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\95CJ9H8G\ClinesModel.r; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TJLQQFEC\Colautti and Lau - 2015 - Contemporary evolution during invasion evidence f.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\X2BCVMX7\mec13162-sup-0001-SupInfo.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\27FKKNCQ\MetaPCA_Analysis.r; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\G5HTL9PX\MetaPCA_Data.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B347G2H7\README_MetaPCA.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HPABYCN6\README_Selection.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HFZBXJUT\README_SpatialStructure.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A3S68I2P\Selection_Analysis.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LY6E3NLE\Selection_Data.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UVN89KN5\abstract.html; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JMPDQ3IM\SpatialStructure_Analysis.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5PR3WW8K\SpatialStructure_Data.csv","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; invasive species; colonization; common garden; latitudinal clines; QST vs. FST; quantitative traits; rapid evolution; selection differentials; selection gradients","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To rescue populations from these threats, conservation biologists can augment gene flow into small populations to increase variation and reduce inbreeding depression. Spectacular success stories include greater prairie chickens in Illinois (Westermeier et al. ), adders in Sweden (Madsen et al. ) and panthers in Florida (Johnson et al. ). However, we also know that performing such crosses risks introducing genes that may be poorly adapted to local conditions or genetic backgrounds. A classic example of such ‘outbreeding depression’ occurred when different subspecies of ibex from Turkey and the Sinai were introduced to assist recovery of an ibex population in Czechoslovakia (Templeton ). Despite being fertile, the hybrids birthed calves too early, causing the whole population to disappear. In the face of uncertainty, conservation biologists have tended to respect genetic identity, shying away from routinely crossing populations. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Frankham () compiles empirical data from experimental studies to assess the costs and benefits of between-population crosses (Fig. ). Crosses screened to exclude those involving highly divergent populations or distinct habitats show large heterosis with few apparent risks of outbreeding depression. This leads Frankham to advocate for using assisted gene flow more widely.

Litter from a pool of eight leaf species was analyzed for chemistry traits affecting decomposition (lignin, nitrogen, and phosphorus) and assembled in all of the 28 possible two-species combinations. Litter dissimilarity was characterized in terms of a range of trait-diversity measures, using Euclidean and Gower distances and dendrogram-based indices. We found large differences in decomposition rates among leaf species, but no significant relationships between decomposition rate of individual leaf species and litter trait dissimilarity, irrespective of whether decomposition was mediated by microbes alone or by both microbes and litter-consuming invertebrates. Likewise, no effects of trait dissimilarity emerged on either fungal biomass accrual or changes during decomposition of nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations in individual leaf species. In line with recent meta-analyses, these results provide support for the contention that litter diversity effects on decomposition, at least in streams, are less pronounced than effects on terrestrial primary productivity.","2015-02-01","2018-01-17 01:15:09","2018-02-22 04:16:45","2018-01-17 01:15:09","550-561","","2","96","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 221","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XHSFFH4K\Frainer et al. - 2015 - No evidence for leaf-trait dissimilarity effects o.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WAZPXK54\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Primary Study","functional diversity; biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; detritus breakdown; ergosterol fungal biomass; functional plant litter traits; nitrogen immobilization; phosphorus dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultimately, such models will allow assessment of future changes in ecosystem structure and function as a result of environmental changes. * A comprehensive worldwide data base was compiled of the fish assemblage composition and environmental characteristics of estuaries. Generalized Linear Models were used to quantify how variation in species richness among estuaries is related to historical events, energy dynamics and ecosystem characteristics, while controlling for sampling effects. * At the global extent, species richness differed among marine biogeographic realms and continents and increased with mean sea surface temperature, terrestrial net primary productivity and the stability of connectivity with a marine ecosystem (open vs. temporarily open estuaries). At a smaller extent (within a marine biogeographic realm or continent), other characteristics were also important in predicting variation in species richness, with species richness increasing with estuary area and continental shelf width. * The results suggest that species richness in an estuary is defined by predictors that are spatially hierarchical. Over the largest spatial extents, species richness is influenced by the broader distributions and habitat use patterns of marine and freshwater species that can colonize estuaries, which are in turn governed by history contingency, energy dynamics and productivity variables. Species richness is also influenced by more regional and local parameters that can further affect the process of community colonization in an estuary including the connectivity of the estuary with the adjacent marine habitat, and, over smaller spatial extents, the size of these habitats. In summary, patterns of species richness in estuaries across large spatial extents seem to reflect from global to local processes acting on community colonization.

Using meta-analysis of 118 field and laboratory experiments in freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, we tested hypotheses about co-limitation of N and P by comparing the effects of adding N alone, P alone, and both N and P together on internal N (e.g. %N, C:N) and P (e.g. %P, C:P) concentrations in autotroph communities. In particular, we tested the following predictions. First, if only one nutrient was limiting, addition of that nutrient should decrease the concentration of the other nutrient, but addition of the non-limiting nutrient would have no effect on the internal concentration of the limiting nutrient. If community co-limitation was occurring then addition of either nutrient should result in a decrease in the internal concentration of the other nutrient. Community co-limitation could also result in no change – or even an increase – in N concentrations in response to P addition if P stimulated growth of N fixers. Finally, if biochemically dependent co-limitation was occurring, addition of a limiting nutrient would not decrease, and could even increase, the concentration of the other, co-limited nutrient. We found no general evidence for the decrease in the internal concentration of one nutrient due to addition of another nutrient. The one exception to this overall pattern was marine systems, where N addition decreased internal P concentrations. In contrast, P addition increased internal N concentrations across all experiments, consistent with co-limitation. These results have important implications for understanding the roles that N and P play in controlling producer growth and internal nutrient accumulation as well as for managing the effects of nutrient enrichment in ecosystems.  Synthesis On a global scale, humans have doubled nitrogen (N) inputs and quadrupled phosphorus (P) inputs relative to pre-industrial levels. N and P fertilization influences autotroph internal nutrient concentrations and ratios and thereby affects a variety of community and ecosystem processes, including decomposition and consumer population dynamics. It is therefore critical to understand the effects of nutrient additions on the growth and nutrient concentrations of primary producers. We used meta-analysis to evaluate the responses of autotroph internal N and P concentrations to additions of N, P, and N+P and make inferences about limitation and co-limitation of N and P across marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems. We found little evidence for single-nutrient limitation, highlighting the fact that multiple nutrients generally limit primary production.","2015-02-01","2018-01-23 06:32:00","2018-02-22 04:47:30","2018-01-23 06:32:00","113-121","","2","124","","Oikos","Signatures of nutrient limitation and co-limitation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 223","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6NHBYWNM\Bracken et al. - 2015 - Signatures of nutrient limitation and co-limitatio.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\N8RJ5ZG8\oik-01215.pdf","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, individual behavioural and physiological measures have been proposed as more rapid links between environmental variation and fitness compared to demographics. Glucocorticoid hormones have received much attention given that they mediate energetic demands, metabolism, and foraging behaviour. However, it is currently unclear whether glucocorticoids can reliably predict environmental and fitness-related traits and whether they may be useful in specific groups of taxa. In particular, seabirds are a well-studied avian group often employed as biomonitoring tools for environmental change given their wide distribution and reliance on large oceanic patterns. Despite the increase in studies attempting to link variation in baseline corticosterone (the primary avian glucocorticoid) to variation in fitness-related traits in seabirds, there has been no comprehensive review of the relationship in this taxon. We present a phylogenetically controlled systematic review and meta-analysis of correlative and experimental studies examining baseline corticosterone as a predictor of fitness-related traits relevant to predicting seabird population health. Our results suggest that, while variation in baseline corticosterone may be a useful predictor of larger-scale environmental traits such as overall food availability and fitness-related traits such as reproductive success, this hormone may not be sensitive enough to detect variation in body condition, foraging effort, and breeding effort. Overall, our results support recent work suggesting that the use of baseline glucocorticoids as conservation biomarkers is complex and highly context dependent, and we suggest caution in their use and interpretation as simplified, direct biomarkers of fitness.","2017-02-01","2018-01-23 06:36:06","2018-02-22 04:46:50","2018-01-23 06:36:06","353-365","","2","183","","Oecologia","Effectiveness of baseline corticosterone as a monitoring tool for fitness","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 045","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TLVFQ6TT\442_2016_3774_MOESM1_ESM.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MY9J68DF\Sorenson et al. - 2017 - Effectiveness of baseline corticosterone as a moni.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8BQ9SCK3\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding of the mechanisms of Si-mediated stress alleviation is progressing, and several reviews have brought information together. A quantitative assessment of the alleviative capacity of Si, however, which could elucidate plant Si function more broadly, was lacking. * We combined the results of 145 experiments, predominantly on agricultural species, in a meta-analysis to statistically assess the responses of stressed plants to Si supply across multiple plant families and abiotic stresses. We interrogated our database to determine whether stressed plants increased in dry mass and net assimilation rate, oxidative stress markers were reduced, antioxidant responses were increased and whether element uptake showed consistent changes when supplied with Si. * We demonstrated that across plant families and stress types, Si increases dry weight, assimilation rate and chlorophyll biosynthesis and alleviates oxidative damage in stressed plants. In general, results indicated that plant family (as a proxy for accumulator type) and stress type had significant explanatory power for variation in responses. The consistent reduction in oxidative damage was not mirrored by consistent increases in antioxidant production, indicative of the several different stress alleviation mechanisms in which Si is involved. Silicon addition increased K in shoots, decreased As and Cd in roots and Na and Cd in shoots. Silicon addition did not affect Al, Ca or Mn concentration in shoots and roots of stressed plants. Plants had significantly lower concentrations of Si accumulated in shoots but not in roots when stressed. * Meta-analyses showed consistent alleviation by Si of oxidative damage caused by a range of abiotic stresses across diverse species. Our findings indicate that Si is likely to be a useful fertilizer for many crops facing a spectrum of abiotic stresses. Similarities in responses across families provide strong support for a role of Si in the alleviation of abiotic stress in natural systems, where it has barely been explored. We suggest this role may become more important under a changing climate and more experiments using non-agricultural species are now needed.","2016-08-01","2018-01-23 06:38:21","2018-02-22 04:47:13","2018-01-23 06:38:21","1340-1357","","8","30","","Funct Ecol","Consistent alleviation of abiotic stress with silicon addition","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 099","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DGSUATH5\Data description for Cooke and Leishman.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QRBSZWEQ\Effect size data.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DFM6EPCQ\fec12713-sup-0001-LaySummary.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BEEX54RU\fec12713-sup-0002-SupInfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LCQJQ4S7\Cooke and Leishman - 2016 - Consistent alleviation of abiotic stress with sili.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XBISGZCI\README.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V7FSR7U5\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","oxidative stress; agriculture; heavy metal toxicity; silica; silicon fertilizer; stress alleviation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This process, known as ecological intensification, will depend in large part on enhancing below-ground biological interactions that facilitate resource use efficiency. Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations formed between the roots of most terrestrial plant species and a specialized group of soil fungi, provide valuable ecosystem services, but the full magnitude of these services may not be fully realized under conventional intensively managed annual agricultural systems. * Here, we use meta-analysis to assess how reducing soil disturbance and periods without roots in agricultural systems affect the formation of AM and the diversity and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We compiled data from 54 field studies across five continents that measured effects of tillage and/or cover cropping on AMF colonization and/or communities and assessed effects of management and environmental factors on these responses. * Less intensive tillage and winter cover cropping similarly increased AMF colonization of summer annual cash crop roots by ∼30%. The key variables influencing the change in AMF colonization were the type of cover crop or the type of alternative tillage, suggesting that farmers can optimize combinations of tillage and cover crops that most enhance AM formation, particularly with no-till systems and legume cover crops. * Richness of AMF taxa increased by 11% in low-intensity vs. conventional tillage regimes. Several studies showed changes in diversity and community composition of AMF with cover cropping, but these responses were not consistent. * Synthesis and applications. This meta-analysis indicates that less intensive tillage and cover cropping are both viable strategies for enhancing root colonization from indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) across a wide range of soil types and cash crop species, and possibly also shifting AMF community structure, which could in turn increase biologically based resource use in agricultural systems.","2017-12-01","2018-02-22 05:18:19","2018-02-22 05:19:07","2018-02-22 05:18:19","1785-1793","","6","54","","J Appl Ecol","Ecological intensification and arbuscular mycorrhizas","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 001","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\77BEXJ45\AMF colonization and cover crops and tillage.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PPP9M8CK\Bowles et al. - 2017 - Ecological intensification and arbuscular mycorrhi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PP66UEJJ\jpe12815-sup-0001-AppendixS1.docx","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; ecosystem services; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; below-ground biological interactions; cover crops; ecological intensification; intensive agriculture; soil biodiversity; tillage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a meta-analysis of 76 studies, we demonstrate that alien/native status does not predict the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions among plants. Moreover, we found no evidence that similarity in floral traits or phylogenetic distance between species pairs influences the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions. Instead, we report that aspects of study design, such as distance between the control and nearest neighbour, and/or the arrangement of study plants better predict the impact of a neighbour than does alien/native status. Our study sheds new light on the role that publication bias and experimental design play in the evaluation of key patterns in ecology.

This hypothesis is based on an assumed concordance between geographical peripherality and ecological marginality such that environmental conditions become harsher towards the limits of a species range. In this way, the CPH sets the stage for understanding the causes of distribution limits. To date, no study has examined conjointly the consistency of these postulates. In an extensive literature review we discuss the birth and development of the CPH and provide an assessment of the CPH by reviewing 248 empirical studies in the context of three main themes. First, a decrease in species occurrence towards their range limits was observed in 81% of studies, while only 51% demonstrated reduced abundance of individuals. A decline in genetic variation, increased differentiation among populations and higher rates of inbreeding were demonstrated by roughly one in two studies (47, 45 and 48%, respectively). However, demographic rates, size and population performance less often followed CPH expectations (20–30% of studies). We highlight the impact of important methodological, taxonomic, and biogeographical biases on such validation rates. Second, we found that geographic and ecological marginality gradients are not systematically concordant, which casts doubt on the reliability of a main assumption of the CPH. Finally, we attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of geographical, ecological and historical processes on the spatial distribution of genetic and demographic parameters. While ecological marginality gradients explain variation in species' demographic performance better than geographic gradients, contemporary and historical factors may contribute interactively to spatial patterns of genetic variation. We thereby propose a framework that integrates species' ecological niche characteristics together with current and past range structure to investigate spatial patterns of genetic and demographic variation across species ranges.","2017-11-01","2018-02-22 05:29:13","2021-03-11 08:58:07","2018-02-22 05:29:13","1877-1909","","4","92","","Biol Rev","Geographic variation in genetic and demographic performance","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 007","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NHPMF26F\brv12313-sup-0001-AppendixS1.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IX8PS8R8\brv12313-sup-0002-AppendixS2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5QCXCX3J\brv12313-sup-0003-AppendixS3.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XZ3EAB5Z\brv12313-sup-0004-AppendixS4.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BE8WZV2R\brv12313-sup-0005-AppendixS5.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9RSR99HG\brv12313-sup-0006-AppendixS6.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\U67YHH2B\Pironon et al. - 2017 - Geographic variation in genetic and demographic pe.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RKU7ZGST\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Not MA - Other Review","abundant-center model; centre-periphery hypothesis; demography; ecological marginality; genetic diversity; meta-analysis; range limits; rear-leading edge; species distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we used meta-analyses to test whether such expected positive relationship between sexual ornamentation and viability exists in the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, which is one of the most studied model species of sexual selection under field conditions. We found a mean positive effect size of viability in relation to the expression of secondary sexual characters of 0.181 (CI: 0.084–0.278), indicating that in this species the more ornamented individuals are more viable, and therefore of high quality. Analyses of moderator variables showed similar effects in males and females, the H. r. rustica subspecies rather than others and tail length rather than other secondary sexual characters.

Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation. * To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498 individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density, grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle (43) or sheep (22) grazing. * All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover, above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation. * Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density, salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential. * Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing, potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities. * Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties, creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe. Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem services.","2017-10-01","2018-02-22 05:49:45","2018-02-22 05:50:18","2018-02-22 05:49:45","1395-1405","","5","54","","J Appl Ecol","Livestock grazing alters multiple ecosystem properties and services in salt marshes","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 010","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I8NAWSEQ\Davidson et al. - 2017 - Livestock grazing alters multiple ecosystem proper.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WBJ6K8PA\GrazingMAdata.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\N68MYTX2\jpe12892-sup-0001-FigS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\79AUEHD4\jpe12892-sup-0002-FigS2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\II8JAQ3Q\jpe12892-sup-0003-FigS3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8Z5I26W2\jpe12892-sup-0004-FigS4.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AY769M89\jpe12892-sup-0005-TableS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BIBBGW8P\jpe12892-sup-0006-TableS2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\22TWR2XS\jpe12892-sup-0007-TableS3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5JYW6MZD\jpe12892-sup-0008-AppendixS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XHIEZSH9\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","biodiversity; blue carbon; cattle; coastal protection; ecosystem service trade-offs; grasslands; horses; sheep; soil; vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantitative estimates of territory size over a broad range of food abundance are relatively rare because of the difficulty of measuring food abundance in the wild. * Stream salmonids are an ideal model system for investigating flexibility in territory size, because food abundance can be quantified in the field and manipulated in the laboratory. We conducted a meta-analysis to test whether territory size decreases with increasing food abundance, and a mixed model analysis to test among three competing predictions: with increasing food abundance, territory size will be (1) fixed—the slope of a regression of log territory size vs. log food abundance = 0; (2) flexible and decreasing, as if individuals are defending a fixed amount of food—a slope = −1; and (3) initially compressible, but with an asymptotic minimum size—a slope between 0 and −1. * We collected data from 16 studies that manipulated or measured food abundance while monitoring changes in territory size of young-of-the-year salmonids; 10 were experimental laboratory studies, whereas six were observational field studies. * Overall, territory size decreased significantly with increasing food abundance; the weighted average correlation coefficient was −0.31. However, the estimated slope of the relationship between log territory size and log food abundance was only −0.23, significantly different from 0, and also significantly shallower than −1. * Our estimated slope suggests that attempts to increase the density of territorial salmonids by increasing food abundance and reducing territory size will be inefficient; a 20-fold increase in food abundance would be required to double population density. Our analysis may also have implications for other species with a territorial mosaic social system—i.e. contiguous territories. In these social systems, social inertia will dampen any effects of changes in food abundance on the local density of settlers, compared to non-territorial species or those with non-contiguous territories.","2017-11-01","2018-03-01 02:22:05","2018-03-08 01:28:18","2018-03-01 02:22:05","1308-1316","","6","86","","J Anim Ecol","Territory size decreases minimally with increasing food abundance in stream salmonids","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 011","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FDV3ZB3N\Grant et al. - 2017 - Territory size decreases minimally with increasing.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\L6QA2AV3\Grant et al. data for archive.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SQTITKPC\jane12737-sup-0001-Supinfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\M98ZSK39\abstract;jsessionid=8A7AEBF094F2EA83524199F0932BBA89.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","contiguous territories; density limitation; elastic disc model; population density; stream salmonids; territoriality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such models are often considered to provide a maximum estimate of mortality and therefore offer a precautionary approach to impact assessment. However, this perception assumes that density dependence operates as compensatory (negative density dependence), and overlooks that other forms of density dependence, such as depensation (positive density dependence), would generate a contrasting population response. * Currently, there is debate about including density-dependent mechanisms in models that assess the impact of offshore wind farms on marine bird populations. Density dependence is considered poorly understood for this group of species. Consequently, it is either excluded from assessments, or incorporated in a compensatory form that has little empirical validation. * We reviewed the evidence for compensatory and depensatory regulation of 31 marine bird species, and conducted a meta-analysis to examine the functional shape of density-dependent population growth. The evidence was also evaluated in relation to established species-specific indices of wind farm vulnerability in order to assess whether compensatory mechanisms are likely to offset losses associated with collision or displacement. * Compensatory regulation was reported across all of the demographic processes and focal groups considered, and was attributed to a variety of causal mechanisms. The strength of compensatory population growth appeared consistent between colonies; however, the regulation of productivity was highly context-dependent with a similar number of studies reporting compensatory, depensatory and insignificant effects. Depensation was consistently attributed to increased rates of predation at lower population densities. * Synthesis and applications. We conclude that among marine bird species with high vulnerability to wind farms, compensatory regulation is unlikely to offset large and sustained losses from the breeding population. In addition, depensation has the potential to accelerate population declines and generate local or regional extinctions, especially in smaller colonial species. Consequently, density-independent models will not offer a consistently precautionary approach for assessing the potential impact of wind farms on marine bird populations. Instead, assessments should examine the potential population response using a range of density-dependent structures.","2017-10-01","2018-03-06 07:14:06","2018-03-08 01:28:08","2018-03-06 07:14:05","1406-1414","","5","54","","J Appl Ecol","Density dependence and marine bird populations","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 013","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J62CU6B3\Horswill et al. - 2017 - Density dependence and marine bird populations ar.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K5LZMSGQ\jpe12841-sup-0001-TableS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2Q54P9KQ\jpe12841-sup-0002-TableS2.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TLMTA27Y\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","demography; density dependence; environmental impact assessment; population dynamics; population management; population regulation; sea duck; seabird; vital rates; wind farms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether at rest or active, animals are constrained to operate within the energetic bounds determined by their minimum (minMR) and sustained or maximum metabolic rates (upperMR). MinMR and upperMR can differ considerably among individuals and species but are often presumed to be mechanistically linked to one another. Specifically, minMR is thought to reflect the idling cost of the machinery needed to support upperMR. However, previous analyses based on limited datasets have come to conflicting conclusions regarding the generality and strength of their association. * Here we conduct the first comprehensive assessment of their relationship, based on a large number of published estimates of both the intra-specific (n = 176) and inter-specific (n = 41) phenotypic correlations between minMR and upperMR, estimated as either exercise-induced maximum metabolic rate (VO2max), cold-induced summit metabolic rate (Msum), or daily energy expenditure (DEE). * Our meta-analysis shows that there is a general positive association between minMR and upperMR that is shared among vertebrate taxonomic classes. However, there was stronger evidence for intra-specific correlations between minMR and Msum and between minMR and DEE than there was for a correlation between minMR and VO2max across different taxa. As expected, inter-specific correlation estimates were consistently higher than intra-specific estimates across all traits and vertebrate classes. * An interesting exception to this general trend was observed in mammals, which contrast with birds and exhibit no correlation between minMR and Msum. We speculate that this is due to the evolution and recruitment of brown fat as a thermogenic tissue, which illustrates how some species and lineages might circumvent this seemingly general association. * We conclude that, in spite of some variability across taxa and traits, the contention that minMR and upperMR are positively correlated generally holds true both within and across vertebrate species. Ecological and comparative studies should therefore take into consideration the possibility that variation in any one of these traits might partly reflect correlated responses to selection on other metabolic parameters.

However, our knowledge of NCEs in arthropod systems is lacking. Factors related to study organism and environment have the potential to influence the occurrence and magnitude of NCEs in arthropod systems. While factors such as coevolutionary history of natural enemies and their prey, predator cue, predator or prey feeding mode, and refuge availability have been theoretically and empirically examined, no trends have been proposed for arthropods. We compiled 62 studies, yielding 128 predator–prey interactions, which explicitly examined NCEs in experiments where arthropods were identified to species, using a previously published database of papers from 1990 to 2005 and a new database of papers published from 2006 to 2015. Using these data, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the influence of organismal and environmental characteristics on the magnitude of predator NCEs. Our analysis addressed the following three questions. 1) Does predator–prey coevolution give rise to stronger NCEs than when predator and prey species did not coevolve? 2) What influence does habitat type and refuge availability have on NCEs? 3) How do predator characteristics (cue type, hunting mode and life stage) and prey characteristics (mobility, life stage, specialization, gregariousness and feeding mode) influence NCEs? We found that while NCEs were similar across most measured characteristics, NCEs on prey activity were significantly stronger when predator and prey shared an evolutionary history. Our results support growing evidence that NCEs have a negative effect on prey traits and that behavioral NCEs are stronger than physiological ones. Additional studies are needed to be confident in any emerging patterns, therefore we identify key gaps in the literature on NCEs in arthropod systems and discuss ideas for moving forward.","2017-09-01","2018-03-08 01:27:01","2018-03-08 01:27:39","2018-03-08 01:27:01","1233-1240","","9","126","","Oikos","A meta-analysis of non-consumptive predator effects in arthropods","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 015","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JMJ3K6X6\Buchanan et al_Oikos_Metaanalysis data.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\38IGS223\Buchanan et al. - 2017 - A meta-analysis of non-consumptive predator effect.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5HEL8KTS\oik-04384.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CNJF4WPK\abstract;jsessionid=CAC622DD52511E50981E81DBA9234D79.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the mechanisms that may drive this mutualism, the most studied is provisioning of nutrients by AMF in exchange for carbon from plant hosts. However, AMF may also provide a suite of non-nutritional benefits to plants including improved water uptake, disease resistance, plant chemical defense, soil aggregation, and allelochemical transport and protection. Here, we use a meta-analysis of 93 studies to assess the relative effect of AMF on nutritional and non-nutritional factors that may influence plant fitness. We find that the positive effects of AMF on soil aggregation, water flow and disease resistance are equal to the effect of AMF on plant nitrogen and phosphorus uptake. However, AMF had no effect on the uptake of other nutrients, plant water content, allelopathic transport or production of chemical defense compounds. We suggest future research directions, including experimentally assessing the relative contribution on plant fitness of AMF interactions by untangling the independence of alternative benefits of AMF from an increase in nutrient uptake. This will lead to a more holistic view of the mycorrhizal-plant association and a more accurate picture of the net impact on the plant or plant community in question.","2017-08-01","2018-03-08 01:54:24","2018-03-08 01:56:08","2018-03-08 01:54:24","2111-2119","","8","98","","Ecology","Beyond nutrients","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 018","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MRJ3LGSB\ecy1892-sup-0001-AppendixS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\H8V27G5W\ecy1892-sup-0002-DataS1.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6MHHF65W\ecy1892-sup-0003-MetadataS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9R4PI2FK\Delavaux et al. - 2017 - Beyond nutrients a meta-analysis of the diverse e.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QIR8Q7RA\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; plant defense; allelochemical protection; allelochemical transport; arbuscular mycorrhizas; disease resistance; mutualism-parasitism continuum; nutrient uptake; plant chemical defense; soil aggregation; water uptake","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Animal species richness and composition often change with decreased forest structural complexity associated with logging. Yet differences in latitude and forest type may strongly influence how species diversity responds to logging. We performed a meta-analysis of logging effects on local species richness and composition of birds across the world and assessed responses by different guilds (nesting strata, foraging strata, diet, and body size). This approach allowed identification of species attributes that might underlie responses to this anthropogenic disturbance. We only examined studies that allowed forests to regrow naturally following logging, and accounted for logging intensity, spatial extent, successional regrowth after logging, and the change in species composition expected due to random assembly from regional species pools. Selective logging in the tropics and clearcut logging in temperate latitudes caused loss of species from nearly all forest strata (ground to canopy), leading to substantial declines in species richness (up to 27% of species). Few species were lost or gained following any intensity of logging in lower-latitude temperate forests, but the relative abundances of these species changed substantially. Selective logging at higher-temperate latitudes generally replaced late-successional specialists with early-successional specialists, leading to no net changes in species richness but large changes in species composition. Removing less basal area during logging mitigated the loss of avian species from all forests and, in some cases, increased diversity in temperate forests. This meta-analysis provides insights into the important role of habitat specialization in determining differential responses of animal communities to logging across tropical and temperate latitudes.","2017-08-01","2018-03-08 02:02:55","2018-03-08 02:03:41","2018-03-08 02:02:55","1657-1674","","3","92","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 019","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PELUCL22\brv12300-sup-0001-SuppInfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8QN5LLE9\LaManna and Martin - 2017 - Logging impacts on avian species richness and comp.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HHZJ4MUW\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; reproductive success; community ecology; biodiversity; species richness; birds; habitat specialization; logging; species composition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different sexual selection regimes may occur among populations/subspecies within the same species. This is particularly the case when mate choice is based on multiple sexually selected traits. However, empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis at the among-populations level is scarce. We conducted a meta-analysis of the intensity of sexual selection on the largest database to date for a single species, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), relying on quantitative estimates of sexual selection. The intensity of sexual selection was expressed as the strength (effect size) of the relationships between six plumage ornaments (tail length, tail asymmetry, size of white spots on tail, ventral plumage colour, throat plumage colour and throat patch size) and several fitness proxies related to reproduction, parental care, offspring quality, arrival date from spring migration, and survival. The data were gathered for four geographically separated subspecies (H. r. rustica, H. r. erythrogaster, H. r. gutturalis, H. r. transitiva). The overall mean effect size (Zr = 0.214; 95% confidence interval = 0.175–0.254; N = 329) was of intermediate magnitude, with intensity of sexual selection being stronger in males than in females. Effect sizes varied during the breeding cycle, being larger before egg deposition, when competition for access to mates reaches its maximum (i.e. in the promiscuous part of the breeding cycle), and decreasing thereafter. In addition, effect sizes from experiments were not significantly larger than those from correlative studies. Finally, sexual selection on different sexually dimorphic traits varied among subspecies. This last result suggests that morphological divergence among populations has partly arisen from divergent sexual selection, which may eventually lead to speciation.","2017-08-01","2018-03-08 02:08:52","2018-03-08 02:11:14","2018-03-08 02:08:52","1582-1600","","3","92","","Biol Rev","Geographical and seasonal variation in the intensity of sexual selection in the barn swallow Hirundo rustica","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 021","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ASUD37DK\brv12297-sup-0001-TableS1.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BRKNMHZS\brv12297-sup-0002-TableS2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NVDHKALT\brv12297-sup-0003-TableS3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4UK62784\Romano et al. - 2017 - Geographical and seasonal variation in the intensi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EGCW5I4Z\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; Hirundo rustica; sexual selection; mate choice; speciation; barn swallow; subspecies; multiple sexually selected traits; population divergence; secondary sexual traits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the aim to reconcile the different viewpoints on the stress-interaction relationship in alpine environments we hypothesized that fine nurse variations within a single life form (cushion) may explain this pattern variability. To test this hypothesis, we compared the magnitude of the stress-interaction relationship in a single study area with that observed in existing studies involving cushions, worldwide. We characterized the nurse effects of cushions on the whole plant community at inter-specific, intra-specific and intra-individual levels along a stress gradient in the dry, alpine tropics of Bolivia (4400 m, 4700 m and 4900 m a.s.l). Using a relative index of interaction (RII) we included our data in a meta-analysis on the nurse effects of cushions along alpine gradients, worldwide. At inter-specific level, the loose cushion Pycnophyllum was a better nurse than the compact Azorella compacta. However, at intra-individual level facilitation was higher at the periphery than at the centre of cushions, exceeding in magnitude the variation observed at inter-specific level. This pattern was associated with higher minimum temperature and lower mortality at the periphery of cushions. The net effects of cushions on plant communities became more positive at higher elevation, corroborating the SGH. Within our single site in Bolivia, fine morphological nurse variations captured a similar variability in the stress-interaction relationship as that observed in a subset of studies on cushions on a worldwide scale. This suggests that fine variations in nurse traits, in general those not considered in protocols dealing with facilitation or in restoration/conservation management plans, explain in part the current discrepancies among SGH studies in alpine regions.","2017-07-01","2018-03-08 02:13:26","2018-03-08 02:14:19","2018-03-08 02:13:26","1173-1183","","8","126","","Oikos","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 022","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CFED5YRB\Data1_RII intraindividual.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5MLF2N8Z\Data2_interspecific.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8T3N2J7G\Data3_intraspecific.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BQDHVFS5\Data4_mortality.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\52GWFBPP\Data5_temperature.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\34CTLBFF\Data6_cushoin compaction.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5X43J7PF\Data7_cushion parameters.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5CPDQPEA\Anthelme et al. - 2017 - Fine nurse variations explain discrepancies in the.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P8N3Q3D9\oik-04248.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\23CUIWWU\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, wolves have also long represented a primary source of human–carnivore conflict, which has led to long-term persecution of wolves, resulting in a significant decrease in their numbers, genetic diversity and gene flow between populations. For more effective protection and management of wolf populations in Europe, robust scientific evidence is crucial. This review serves as an analytical summary of the main findings from wolf population genetic studies in Europe, covering major studies from the ‘pre-genomic era’ and the first insights of the ‘genomics era’. We analyse, summarize and discuss findings derived from analyses of three compartments of the mammalian genome with different inheritance modes: maternal (mitochondrial DNA), paternal (Y chromosome) and biparental [autosomal microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]. To describe large-scale trends and patterns of genetic variation in European wolf populations, we conducted a meta-analysis based on the results of previous microsatellite studies and also included new data, covering all 19 European countries for which wolf genetic information is available: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Belarus, Russia, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Spain and Portugal. We compared different indices of genetic diversity in wolf populations and found a significant spatial trend in heterozygosity across Europe from south-west (lowest genetic diversity) to north-east (highest). The range of spatial autocorrelation calculated on the basis of three characteristics of genetic diversity was 650−850 km, suggesting that the genetic diversity of a given wolf population can be influenced by populations up to 850 km away. As an important outcome of this synthesis, we discuss the most pressing issues threatening wolf populations in Europe, highlight important gaps in current knowledge, suggest solutions to overcome these limitations, and provide recommendations for science-based wolf conservation and management at regional and Europe-wide scales.","2017-08-01","2018-03-08 02:22:58","2018-03-08 02:23:46","2018-03-08 02:22:58","1601-1629","","3","92","","Biol Rev","Wolf population genetics in Europe","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 023","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2267NXI9\brv12298-sup-0001-Appendix_S1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZZHCXVA6\brv12298-sup-0002-Appendix_S2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AX67DIBU\brv12298-sup-0003-Appendix_S3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IX9ICVSP\brv12298-sup-0004-Appendix_S4.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7Z4FWGEA\Hindrikson et al. - 2017 - Wolf population genetics in Europe a systematic r.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XUPUBYX7\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","Canis lupus; conservation genomics; European Union policy; gene flow; large carnivores; microsatellites; mitochondrial DNA; SNP; wolf management; Y chromosome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this view is largely based on isolated studies and qualitative reviews. Here, for the first time, we quantitatively determined whether ant nests affect soil fertility and plant performance, and identified the possible sources of variation of these effects. * Using Bayesian mixed-models meta-analysis, we tested the hypotheses that ant effects on soil fertility and plant performance depend on the substrate sampled, ant feeding type, latitude, habitat and the plant response variable measured. * Ant nests showed higher nutrient and cation content than adjacent non-nest soil samples, but similar pH. Nutrient content was higher in ant refuse materials than in nest soils. The fertilizer effect of ant nests was also higher in dry habitats than in grasslands or savannas. Cation content was higher in nests of plant-feeding ants than in nests of omnivorous species, and lower in nests from agro-ecosystems than in nests from any other habitat. * Plants showed higher green/root biomass and fitness on ant nests soils than in adjacent, non-nest sites; but plant density and diversity were unaffected by the presence of ant nests. Root growth was particularly higher in refuse materials than in ant nest soils, in leaf-cutting ant nests and in deserts habitats. * Our results confirm the major role of ant nests in influencing soil fertility and vegetation patterns and provide information about the factors that mediate these effects. First, ant nests improve soil fertility mainly through the accumulation of refuse materials. Thus, different refuse dump locations (external or in underground nest chambers) could benefit different vegetation life-forms. Second, ant nests could increase plant diversity at larger spatial scales only if the identity of favoured plants changes along environmental gradients (i.e. enhancing β-diversity). Third, ant species that feed on plants play a relevant role fertilizing soils, which may balance their known influence as primary consumers. Fourth, the effects of ant nests as fertility islands are larger in arid lands, possibly because fertility is intrinsically lower in these habitats. Overall, this study provide novel and quantitative evidence confirming that ant nests are key soil modifiers, emphasizing their role as ecological engineers.","2017-07-01","2018-03-08 02:59:42","2018-03-08 03:00:21","2018-03-08 02:59:42","866-877","","4","86","","J Anim Ecol","The effects of ant nests on soil fertility and plant performance","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 027","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C6FMSCKU\Farji-Brener and Werenkraut - 2017 - The effects of ant nests on soil fertility and pla.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EEGXXLTY\jane12672-sup-0001-AppendixS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HDQM5KWR\jane12672-sup-0002-AppendixS2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MS7MELAZ\jane12672-sup-0003-AppendixS3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UTQMGFAB\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","ants; ecological engineers; soil disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During lactation, females can allocate energy acquired from concurrent resources (income breeding); or utilize energy stored prior to reproduction (capital breeding). Mothers transfer a large proportion of energy to their pups via lipid rich milk, meaning that pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury (Hg) will also transfer, raising concern for negative health effects. To quantify the effect of reproductive strategy on maternal pollutant transfer in pinnipeds, we developed a proxy for income and capital breeding by focusing on the lactational component of reproduction, and arranged species along this gradient. We found a strong positive relationship between lipid content in milk and degree of capital breeding. We tested this gradient against maternal pollutant transfer expressed as a concentration ratio by meta-analysis. In mother-pup pairs, the concentration ratio of PCBs was one order of magnitude higher than for mercury. PCB concentrations in pups and juveniles were similar to adult females, but mercury was always lower in young offspring than in females. We found no effect of reproductive strategy between studies investigating mother-pup pairs and non-related females and juveniles (< 1 year old), however data were strongly biased towards capital breeders. Our results suggest that either: 1) reproductive strategy does not affect pollutant bioaccumulation; or 2) a lack of income breeder data prevents us from testing the overall effect of reproductive strategy on maternal pollutant transfer. The finding that PCB concentrations in juveniles are similar to females is of concern due to early life stage exposure. We recommend data collection from income breeding species such as the sea lions to elucidate whether reproductive strategy, and potentially other life history traits, has an overall effect on maternal pollutant transfer.","2017-06-01","2018-03-08 03:05:41","2018-03-08 03:07:21","2018-03-08 03:05:40","772-781","","6","126","","Oikos","Effects of reproductive strategies on pollutant concentrations in pinnipeds","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 028","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V82MQMX2\Hitchcock et al. - 2017 - Effects of reproductive strategies on pollutant co.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BC9IB2J2\oik-03955_0.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\788XMB7T\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Combining results from multiple experimental studies might produce an aggregate estimate of selection that is more revealing than individual studies. For example, bony pelvic armour varies conspicuously among stickleback populations, and predation by vertebrate and insect predators has been hypothesized to be the main driver of this variation. Yet experimental selection studies testing these hypotheses frequently fail to find a significant effect. We experimentally manipulated length of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) pelvic spines in a mesocosm experiment to test whether prickly sculpin (Cottus asper), an intraguild predator of stickleback, favours longer spines. The probability of survival was greater for stickleback with unclipped pelvic spines, but this effect was noisy and not significant. We used meta-analysis to combine the results of our mesocosm experiment with previously published experimental studies of selection on pelvic armour. We found evidence that fish predation indeed favours increased pelvic armour, with a moderate effect size. The same approach found little evidence that insect predation favours reduced pelvic armour. The causes of reduced pelvic armour in many stickleback populations remain uncertain.","2017-06-01","2018-03-08 03:17:05","2018-03-08 03:17:37","2018-03-08 03:17:05","1165-1176","","6","30","","J.

Here, we use 54 groups of fishes from 48 studies to estimate the degree of concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees in two ecological grades of fishes: marine and freshwater. We test the hypothesis that freshwater fish phylogenies should, on average, show more discordance because of their higher propensity for hybridization in the past. In keeping with this idea, concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees (as measured by proportion of components shared) is on average 50% higher in marine fishes.

Although theory generally predicts increased genetic variation under stress, previous syntheses of the field have found limited support for this notion. These studies have focused on heritability, which is dependent on other environmentally sensitive, but nongenetic, sources of variation. Here, we aim to complement these studies with a meta-analysis in which we examine changes in coefficient of variation (CV) in maternal, genetic, and residual variances across stressful and benign conditions. Confirming previous analyses, we did not find any clear direction in how heritability changes across stressful and benign conditions. However, when analyzing CV, we found higher genetic and residual variance under highly stressful conditions in life-history traits but not in morphological traits.

We conducted a global meta-analysis of published time–activity budgets, using a data set comprising 555 values from 88 studies, to determine variation in the time that waterbirds engaged in aggressive interactions. The mean±SD percentage of time devoted to aggression was 2.0±3.6%, with a range of 0.0–35.0%. We used our data set to test four predictions regarding avian aggression, based on the findings of earlier site-based studies. We predicted that the time spent on aggression would be influenced by four factors: (1) age class, (2) sex, (3) seasonal timing and (4) functional feeding group. A comparison of linear mixed-effects models using an information theoretic approach indicated that the proportion of time waterbirds spent engaged in aggressive interactions was best explained by the age class and sex of the focal waterbird species. More time was spent on aggression by males than females, and by adults than juveniles. We found no evidence that the time spent on aggressive behaviours varied across latitudes or body mass, with seasonal timing, sexual dimorphism, migration or breeding strategies, or between different functional feeding groups. Our findings highlight the high levels of variation in the time devoted to aggression across species, feeding groups, latitudes and seasons.

To address these uncertainties, we performed a global meta-analysis of 58 studies of drought-induced forest mortality. Mortality rates were modelled as a function of drought, temperature, biomes, phylogenetic and functional groups and functional traits. We identified a consistent global-scale response, where mortality increased with drought severity [log mortality (trees trees−1 year−1) increased 0.46 (95% CI = 0.2–0.7) with one SPEI unit drought intensity]. We found no significant differences in the magnitude of the response depending on forest biomes or between angiosperms and gymnosperms or evergreen and deciduous tree species. Functional traits explained some of the variation in drought responses between species (i.e. increased from 30 to 37% when wood density and specific leaf area were included). Tree species with denser wood and lower specific leaf area showed lower mortality responses.

However, generalizing about these effects is difficult because invasive plants represent a wide range of life forms, and invaded ecosystems differ in their plant communities and abiotic conditions. We hypothesize that differences in traits between the invader and native species can be used to predict impacts and so aid generalization. We further hypothesize that environmental conditions at invaded sites modify the effect of trait differences and so combine with traits to predict invasion impacts. To test these hypotheses, we used systematic review to compile data on changes in aboveground and soil carbon pools following non-native plant invasion from studies across the World. Maximum potential height (Hmax) of each species was drawn from trait databases and other sources. We used meta-regression to assess which of invasive species’ Hmax, differences in this height trait between native and invasive plants, and climatic water deficit, a measure of water stress, were good predictors of changes in carbon pools following invasion. We found that aboveground biomass in invaded ecosystems relative to uninvaded ones increased as the value of Hmax of invasive relative to native species increased, but that this effect was reduced in more water stressed ecosystems. Changes in soil carbon pools were also positively correlated with the relative Hmax of invasive species, but were not altered by water stress. This study is one of the first to show quantitatively that the impact of invasive species on an ecosystem may depend on differences in invasive and native species’ traits, rather than solely the traits of invasive species. Our study is also the first to show that the influence of trait differences can be altered by climate. Further developing our understanding of the impacts of invasive species using this framework could help researchers to identify not only potentially dangerous invasive species, but also the ecosystems where impacts are likely to be greatest.","2017-04-01","2018-03-08 07:29:16","2018-03-08 07:29:53","2018-03-08 07:29:16","1026-1035","","4","98","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 037","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GDURMZFD\ecy1711-sup-0001-AppendixS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PE8W6GBY\Martin et al. - 2017 - Impacts of invasive plants on carbon pools depend .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5ICW2EZZ\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; invasive species; carbon storage; ecosystem functioning; impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it remains unclear whether either one alone or both of these potential state variables could be an underlying driver of animal personality. * We address this question using meta-analyses of published data from bird species. We hypothesized that state variables that mediate individual differences in behaviour would display similar or higher repeatability estimates than behavioural traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified repeatability estimates of hormone levels, metabolic rates and behavioural traits. * We found moderate to high mean repeatability estimates for both metabolic rates and behavioural traits, but low repeatability estimates for hormone levels. These findings indicate that metabolic rates likely represent an important mechanism for generating adaptive personality differences in behaviour. * We also show that: (i) for hormones and behaviour, repeatability decreased with increasing interval time between two measurements; (ii) males and females differed in repeatability for behavioural traits; (iii) stress-induced hormone levels were more repeatable than baseline levels. * Future studies are now required to determine the direction of the association between metabolic rates and behavioural traits. At the same time, these studies should try to investigate which of the proposed mechanisms is responsible for the relationship between state variable and state-dependent behaviour. * In addition, we encourage researchers to report the coefficient of variation for between-individual variance (CVB) along with repeatability estimates because these two indices carry different information.

Using null-models and meta-analyses of 22 factorial experiments in herbaceous plant communities across Europe and North America, we show that disturbance diversifies communities when dispersal is limited, but homogenises communities when combined with increased immigration from the species pool. In contrast to the hypothesis that disturbance and dispersal mediate the strength of niche assembly, both processes altered β-diversity through neutral-sampling effects on numbers of individuals and species in communities.

Second, in contrast, the results support the hypothesis that cryptic taxa are more common in certain habitats than others: for a given study effort, more cryptic taxa are found in freshwater than in terrestrial or marine taxa.

Such definitions may be too conservative, as ecologically-relevant non-lethal effects (e.g. consumption and growth) of hypoxia on important aquatic species, such as fish, often occur at oxygen levels much higher than 2.0 mg l–1. In addition, many mechanisms that regulate hypoxia tolerance in fish have been proposed, including temperature, habitat, location in the water column, and body size, but there is ongoing debate over which mechanisms are most important. Using a structured meta-analysis of published studies, we showed consistent, significant negative effects on fish growth and consumption below 4.5 mg l–1. While the total amount of variation explained was generally low, below 4.5 mg l–1 of dissolved oxygen, phylogenetic relationships accounted for most of the explained variation in fish growth. Ecological factors including body size, location in the water column (pelagic, demersal, or benthopelagic), habitat (freshwater, marine, or diadromous), and temperature explained very little of the effect of hypoxia on fish growth and explained only a moderate level of variation in consumption. Our results suggest a dramatically higher threshold for sub-lethal effects of hypoxia on fish than oxygen levels generally set for regulation purposes, and provide little support for accepted ecological mechanisms thought to influence hypoxia tolerance.","2017-03-01","2018-03-12 05:14:43","2018-03-12 05:15:21","2018-03-12 05:14:43","307-317","","3","126","","Oikos","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 042","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8BVXR6EY\ConsumptionData.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CJSQ2VI9\Hrycik et al. - 2017 - Sub-lethal effects on fish provide insight into a .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D4AT9LSF\GrowthData.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WCIKHUHJ\oik-03678.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RTVL7M73\README_ConsumptionData.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D5FX6W6W\README_GrowthData.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SDZED27F\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we evaluated habitat fragmentation effects on both herbivory and herbivore diversity, using novel hierarchical meta-analyses. Across 89 studies, we found a negative effect of habitat fragmentation on abundance and species richness of herbivores, but only a non-significant trend on herbivory. Reduced area and increased isolation of remaining fragments yielded the strongest effect on abundance and species richness, while specialist herbivores were the most vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. These fragmentation effects were more pronounced in studies with large spatial extent. The strong reduction in herbivore diversity, but not herbivory, indicates how important common generalist species can be in maintaining herbivory as a major ecosystem process.","2017-02-01","2018-03-12 05:23:47","2018-03-12 05:24:25","2018-03-12 05:23:47","264-272","","2","20","","Ecol Lett","Responses of insect herbivores and herbivory to habitat fragmentation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 044","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\G9XBZP3R\ele12723-sup-0001-SupInfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RDHNSRU8\Rossetti et al. - 2017 - Responses of insect herbivores and herbivory to ha.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NDLYQ65K\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","effect size; species richness; Body size; feeding type; fragment area; generalist herbivores; insect herbivory; isolation; spatial extent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many studies, both experimental and correlational, have been conducted to test the relationship between immune function and the sex hormones testosterone in males and oestrogen in females. However, the results are mixed. We conducted four cross-species meta-analyses to investigate the relationship between sex hormones and immune function: (i) the effect of testosterone manipulation on immune function in males, (ii) the correlation between circulating testosterone level and immune function in males, (iii) the effect of oestrogen manipulation on immune function in females, and (iv) the correlation between circulating oestrogen level and immune function in females. The results from the experimental studies showed that testosterone had a medium-sized immunosuppressive effect on immune function. The effect of oestrogen, on the other hand, depended on the immune measure used. Oestrogen suppressed cell-mediated immune function while reducing parasite loads. The overall correlation (meta-analytic relationship) between circulating sex hormone level and immune function was not statistically significant for either testosterone or oestrogen despite the power of meta-analysis. These results suggest that correlational studies have limited value for testing the effects of sex hormones on immune function. We found little evidence of publication bias in the four data sets using indirect tests. There was a weak and positive relationship between year of publication and effect size for experimental studies of testosterone that became non-significant after we controlled for castration and immune measure, suggesting that the temporal trend was due to changes in these moderators over time. Graphical analyses suggest that the temporal trend was due to an increased use of cytokine measures across time. We found substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes, except in correlational studies of testosterone, even after we accounted for the relevant random and fixed factors. In conclusion, our results provide good evidence that testosterone suppresses immune function and that the effect of oestrogen varies depending on the immune measure used.","2017-02-01","2018-03-12 05:33:20","2018-03-12 05:34:46","2018-03-12 05:33:20","551-571","","1","92","","Biol Rev","The effects of sex hormones on immune function","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 046","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GZJG4DB3\brv12243-sup-0001-FileS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AUXB6HFG\Foo et al. - 2017 - The effects of sex hormones on immune function a .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9RNCFAKY\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; sexual selection; trade-offs; secondary sexual traits; honest signals; immune function; immunocompetence handicap hypothesis; oestrogen; sex hormones; testosterone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These male-derived benefits can be due to material and/or genetic effects. The latter include an increase in the attractiveness, hence likely mating success, of sons. Females can potentially enhance any sex-biased benefits of mating with certain males by adjusting the offspring sex ratio depending on their mate's phenotype. One hypothesis is that females should produce mainly sons when mating with more attractive or higher quality males. Here we perform a meta-analysis of the empirical literature that has accumulated to test this hypothesis. The mean effect size was small (r = 0.064–0.095; i.e. explaining <1% of variation in offspring sex ratios) but statistically significant in the predicted direction. It was, however, not robust to correction for an apparent publication bias towards significantly positive results. We also examined the strength of the relationship using different indices of male attractiveness/quality that have been invoked by researchers (ornaments, behavioural displays, female preference scores, body condition, male age, body size, and whether a male is a within-pair or extra-pair mate). Only ornamentation and body size significantly predicted the proportion of sons produced. We obtained similar results regardless of whether we ran a standard random-effects meta-analysis, or a multi-level, Bayesian model that included a correction for phylogenetic non-independence. A moderate proportion of the variance in effect sizes (51.6–56.2%) was due to variation that was not attributable to sampling error (i.e. sample size). Much of this non-sampling error variance was not attributable to phylogenetic effects or high repeatability of effect sizes among species. It was approximately equally attributable to differences (occurring for unknown reasons) in effect sizes among and within studies (25.3, 22.9% of the total variance). There were no significant effects of year of publication or two aspects of study design (experimental/observational or field/laboratory) on reported effect sizes. We discuss various practical reasons and theoretical arguments as to why small effect sizes should be expected, and why there might be relatively high variation among studies. Currently, there are no species where replicated, experimental studies show that mothers adjust the offspring sex ratio in response to a generally preferred male phenotype. Ultimately, we need more experimental studies that test directly whether females produce more sons when mated to relatively more attractive males, and that provide the requisite evidence that their sons have higher mean fitness than their daughters.","2017-02-01","2018-03-12 05:40:16","2018-03-12 05:40:58","2018-03-12 05:40:16","108-134","","1","92","","Biol Rev","Facultative adjustment of the offspring sex ratio and male attractiveness","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 049","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YE5VYD6A\brv12220-sup-0001-FigS1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S2EZREDU\brv12220-sup-0002-FigS2.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EVDGJE2V\brv12220-sup-0003-TableS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6KIY67R4\brv12220-sup-0004-TableS2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DNPH8REQ\brv12220-sup-0005-TableS3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QQYCEMVQ\brv12220-sup-0006-AppendixS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Q7PBTLXN\brv12220-sup-0007-AppendixS2.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NKKSX92Q\brv12220-sup-0008-AppendixS3.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PV3YD2D5\Booksmythe et al. - 2017 - Facultative adjustment of the offspring sex ratio .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QJVI2ZCX\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","female choice; sexual selection; mate choice; maternal effects; sex allocation; sex ratio adjustment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. X. XI. XII. XIII. References Summary Plants respond to stress by releasing biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which are abundantly produced across the plant kingdom, comprise an important group within the BVOCs. They can repel or attract herbivores and their natural enemies; and they can induce plant defences or prime plants for enhanced defence against herbivores and pathogens and can have direct toxic effects on bacteria and fungi. Unlike other volatiles, GLVs are released almost instantly upon mechanical damage and (a)biotic stress and could thus function as an immediate and informative signal for many organisms in the plant's environment. We used a meta-analysis approach in which data from the literature on GLV production during biotic stress responses were compiled and interpreted. We identified that different types of attackers and feeding styles add a degree of complexity to the amount of emitted GLVs, compared with wounding alone. This meta-analysis illustrates that there is less variation in the GLV profile than we presumed, that pathogens induce more GLVs than insects and wounding, and that there are clear differences in GLV emission between monocots and dicots. Besides the meta-analysis, this review provides an update on recent insights into the perception and signalling of GLVs in plants.","2017","2018-03-12 05:47:18","2018-03-12 05:49:12","2018-03-12 05:47:18","n/a-n/a","","","","","New Phytol","Green leaf volatile production by plants","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 052","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VUMIGG6M\Ameye et al. - Green leaf volatile production by plants a meta-a.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7I5C32RC\nph14671-sup-0001-SupInfo.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JSSQ5FNB\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; dicot; fungus; green leaf volatile (GLV); herbivore; monocot; pathogen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that specialisation of herbivores on toxic host plants, accompanied by the ability to acquire plant defensive compounds for herbivore defence, is favoured by the lower costs of sequestration compared to de novo synthesis of defensive compounds. We measured physiological costs of chemical defence as a reduction in larval performance in response to repeated removal of secretions (simulating predator attack) and compared these costs between five species synthesising defences de novo and three species sequestering salicylic glucosides (SGs) from their host plants. Experiments simulating low predator pressure revealed no physiological costs in terms of survival, weight and duration of development in any of study species. However, simulation of high predation caused reduction in relative growth rate in Chrysomela lapponica larvae producing autogenous defences more frequently, than in larvae sequestering SGs. Still meta-analysis of combined data showed no overall difference in costs of autogenous and sequestered defences. However, larvae synthesising their defences de novo demonstrated secretion-conserving behaviour, produced smaller amounts of secretions, replenished them at considerably lower rates and employed other types of defences (regurgitation, evasion) more frequently when compared to sequestering larvae. These latter results provide indirect evidence for biosynthetic constraints for amounts of defensive secretions produced de novo, resulting in low defence effectiveness. Lifting these constraints by sequestration may have driven some leaf beetle lineages toward sequestration of plant allelochemicals as the main defensive strategy.","2017-01-01","2018-03-12 06:33:52","2018-03-12 06:34:25","2018-03-12 06:33:52","93-106","","1","183","","Oecologia","Strategies of chemical anti-predator defences in leaf beetles","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 056","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3R3GAHDC\442_2016_3743_MOESM1_ESM.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LBY62TJT\Zvereva et al. - 2017 - Strategies of chemical anti-predator defences in l.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\567HX9XI\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also explored ecological factors that might explain among-studies variation in the magnitude of the earthworm effects on plant growth and resistance. * We found that earthworm presence increases plant growth (by 20%) and nitrogen content (by 11%). Overall, earthworms did not affect plant resistance against chewing herbivores (caterpillars, slugs and rootworms), and even led to a 22% decrease in plant resistance against phloem-feeding herbivores (aphids). However, earthworm presence increased production of chemical defences by 31% when plants where attacked by cell-feeders (thrips), and resulted in an 81% increase in resistance against thrips. The magnitude of earthworm effects was stronger when earthworm inoculations consisted of a mix of species and ecological types, and when densities of earthworms were high. * These results suggest that earthworm presence is an important factor underlying natural variation in plant defences against herbivores, and call for a better integration of the soil fauna in the studies of plant-herbivore interaction, both for applied and fundamental research.

Such limitation is directly relevant for the fate of soil carbon and global element cycles, but its extent and nature have never been assessed systematically across the tropical biome. Here, we address the relative importance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients in limiting soil microbial biomass and process rates in tropical forests. We conducted an in-depth literature review and a meta-analysis of the available nutrient addition experiments in tropical forests worldwide. Our synthesis showed predominant and general phosphorus limitation of a variety of microbial processes across tropical forests, and additional nitrogen limitation in tropical montane forests.

Evidence from a range of vertebrates supports MHC-based preference for diverse and dissimilar mating partners, but evidence from human mate choice studies has been disparate and controversial. Methodologies and sampling peculiarities specific to human studies make it difficult to know whether wide discrepancies in results among human populations are real or artefact. To better understand what processes may affect MHC-mediated mate choice across humans and nonhuman primates, we performed phylogenetically controlled meta-analyses using 58 effect sizes from 30 studies across seven primate species. Primates showed a general trend favouring more MHC-diverse mates, which was statistically significant for humans. In contrast, there was no tendency for MHC-dissimilar mate choice, and for humans, we observed effect sizes indicating selection of both MHC-dissimilar and MHC-similar mates. Focusing on MHC-similar effect sizes only, we found evidence that preference for MHC similarity was an artefact of population ethnic heterogeneity in observational studies but not among experimental studies with more control over sociocultural biases. This suggests that human assortative mating biases may be responsible for some patterns of MHC-based mate choice. Additionally, the overall effect sizes of primate MHC-based mating preferences are relatively weak (Fisher's Z correlation coefficient for dissimilarity Zr = 0.044, diversity Zr = 0.153), calling for careful sampling design in future studies. Overall, our results indicate that preference for more MHC-diverse mates is significant for humans and likely conserved across primates.","2017-01-01","2018-03-12 06:55:26","2018-03-12 06:56:02","2018-03-12 06:55:26","668-688","","2","26","","Mol Ecol","Patterns of MHC-dependent mate selection in humans and nonhuman primates","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 060","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\267JS7P9\Winternitz et al. - 2017 - Patterns of MHC-dependent mate selection in humans.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VN72D4PM\human.primate.matechoice.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZWYLW8DP\mec13920-sup-0001-SupInfo.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ACJV5VSE\primate_tree.nex; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ABA6KLRS\abstract.html; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PCACVSTN\Winternitz_et_al_Rcode_MHCDissimilarity.R","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","sexual selection; good genes; HLA; inbreeding avoidance; major histocompatibility complex; mating preference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While palaeontologists, developmental biologists, and geneticists have made great strides in explaining the origin and early evolution of limb skeletal structures, that of the muscles remains largely unknown. The main reason is the lack of consensus about appendicular muscle homology between the closest living relatives of early tetrapods: lobe-finned fish and crown tetrapods. In the light of a recent study of these homologies, we re-examined osteological correlates of muscle attachment in the pectoral girdle, humerus, radius, and ulna of early tetrapods and their close relatives. Twenty-nine extinct and six extant sarcopterygians were included in a meta-analysis using information from the literature and from original specimens, when possible. We analysed these osteological correlates using parsimony-based character optimization in order to reconstruct muscle anatomy in ancestral lobe-finned fish, tetrapodomorph fish, stem tetrapods, and crown tetrapods. Our synthesis revealed that many tetrapod shoulder muscles probably were already present in tetrapodomorph fish, while most of the more-distal appendicular muscles either arose later from largely undifferentiated dorsal and ventral muscle masses or did not leave clear correlates of attachment in these taxa. Based on this review and meta-analysis, we postulate a stepwise sequence of specific appendicular muscle acquisitions, splits, and fusions that led from the ancestral sarcopterygian pectoral fin to the ancestral tetrapod forelimb. This sequence largely agrees with previous hypotheses based on palaeontological and comparative work, but it is much more comprehensive in terms of both muscles and taxa. Combined with existing information about the skeletal system, our new synthesis helps to illuminate the genetic, developmental, morphological, functional, and ecological changes that were key components of the fins-to-limbs transition.","2017-11-10","2018-03-12 07:04:40","2018-03-12 07:16:12","2018-03-12 07:04:39","n/a-n/a","","","","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 061","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XEHBV2YV\brv12386-sup-0001-FigureS1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KF872YXU\brv12386-sup-0002-TableS1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NDUJAH7W\brv12386-sup-0003-TableS2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CUGR2QQS\brv12386-sup-0004-TableS3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8GK3ZKPI\brv12386-sup-0005-TableS4.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V8JZXAZZ\brv12386-sup-0006-TableS5.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XPG78WJ7\brv12386-sup-0007-TableS6.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZIIV5PGJ\Molnar et al. - Reconstructing pectoral appendicular muscle anatom.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B954VAL9\abstract.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","Acanthostega; Eusthenopteron; extant phylogenetic bracket; Pederpes; Sarcopterygii; stem tetrapods; Tetrapoda; water-land transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we synthesize responses of species richness and evenness from 187 experimental warming studies in a quantitative meta?analysis. We asked 1) whether effects of warming on diversity were detectable and consistent across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, 2) if effects on diversity correlated with intensity, duration, and experimental unit size of temperature change manipulations, and 3) whether these experimental effects on diversity interacted with ecosystem types. Using multilevel mixed linear models and model averaging, we also tested the relative importance of variables that described uncontrolled environmental variation and attributes of experimental units. Overall, experimental warming reduced richness across ecosystems (mean log?response ratio = ?0.091, 95% bootstrapped CI: ?0.13, ?0.05) representing an 8.9% decline relative to ambient temperature treatments. Richness did not change in response to warming in freshwater systems, but was more strongly negative in terrestrial (?11.8%) and marine (?10.5%) experiments. In contrast, warming impacts on evenness were neutral overall and in aquatic systems, but weakly negative on land (7.6%). Intensity and duration of experimental warming did not explain variation in diversity responses, but negative effects on richness were stronger in smaller experimental units, particularly in marine systems. Model?averaged parameter estimation confirmed these main effects while accounting for variation in latitude, ambient temperature at the sites of manipulations, venue (field versus lab), community trophic type, and whether experiments were open or closed to colonization. These analyses synthesize extensive experimental evidence showing declines in local richness with increased temperature, particularly in terrestrial and marine communities. However, the more variable effects of warming on evenness were better explained by the random effect of site identity, suggesting that effects on species? relative abundances were contingent on local species composition. Synthesis A global research priority is to understand the consequences of climate change for biodiversity. A growing number of experimental studies have manipulated climatic drivers, in particular changes in temperature, in local communities. In the first quantitative meta?analysis of community?level studies across freshwater, marine and terrestrial experiments, species richness declined consistently with experimental warming. This effect was insensitive to warming intensity, duration, and multiple environmental and procedural covariates. However, evenness responses were weakly negative only in terrestrial systems and more variable across ecosystem types. Linear mixed model analyses revealed that the identity of local sites explained nearly 50% of variance in evenness effect sizes, compared to only 10% for richness. This result provides evidence that local species composition strongly constrains changes in relative species abundances in response to warming.","2016-09-13","2018-03-26 22:51:35","2018-04-17 05:12:06","2018-03-26 22:51:35","8-17","","1","126","","Oikos","","","","","","","","","","","","","onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 063","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\94A8MNNU\Gruner Daniel S. et al. - 2016 - Effects of experimental warming on biodiversity de.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B2YDYCZJ\oik-03688.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GVCQNNAZ\oik.03688.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GTW9YTCZ\oik.03688.metadata.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\248NKIS3\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uncertainty exists over the importance of N, phosphorus (P) and molybdenum (Mo) availability in controlling free?living N fixation rates. Here, we investigate the geographic occurrence and variability of nutrient constraints to free?living N fixation in the terrestrial biosphere. We compiled data from studies measuring free?living N fixation in response to N, P and Mo fertilizers. We used meta?analysis to quantitatively determine the extent to which N, P and Mo stimulate or suppress N fixation, and if environmental variables influence the degree of nutrient limitation of N fixation. Across our compiled dataset, free?living N fixation is suppressed by N fertilization and stimulated by Mo fertilization. Additionally, free?living N fixation is stimulated by P additions in tropical forests. These findings suggest that nutrient limitation is an intrinsic property of the biochemical demands of N fixation, constraining free?living N fixation in the terrestrial biosphere. These findings have implications for understanding the causes and consequences of N limitation in coupled nutrient cycles, as well as modeling and forecasting nutrient controls over carbon?climate feedbacks.","2018-01-15","2018-03-26 23:28:48","2018-04-17 05:13:02","2018-03-26 23:28:47","1050-1061","","3","217","","New Phytologist","","","","","","","","","","","","","nph-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 064","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\F5PXEXAD\Dynarski Katherine A. and Houlton Benjamin Z. - 2018 - Nutrient limitation of terrestrial free‐living nit.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4XKUXRM5\KAD_NFix_Metaanalysis_Filtered_Data.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K6R8AY8I\KAD_NFix_Metaanalysis_Key.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C9ZMME9R\nph14905-sup-0001-supinfo.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ALE4K3WJ\nph.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","climate change; climate; nutrient limitation; molybdenum (Mo); nitrogen (N) fixation; phosphorus (P)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta?analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges' g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: |g| = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this influence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = ?8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one?year post?hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact fitness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6°C versus 2°C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments fluctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid?temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change.","2018-01-16","2018-03-26 23:38:59","2018-04-17 05:13:49","2018-03-26 23:38:59","72-97","","1","93","","Biological Reviews","Developmental temperatures and phenotypic plasticity in reptiles","","","","","","","","","","","","onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 065","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4F4599RS\analysis_TincMeta.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A8Y7BNLL\brv12333-sup-0001-suppinfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IRMWAKMK\explore_analysis.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HCVMCA7U\figures_final.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IPA9KRWY\Noble Daniel W.

However, infection imposes physiological and behavioural constraints on hosts that may act to curtail parasite dispersal via changes to migratory timing (?migratory separation?) and survival (?migratory culling?). There remains little consensus regarding the frequency and extent to which migratory separation and migratory culling may operate, despite a growing recognition of the importance of these mechanisms in regulating transmission dynamics in migratory animals. We quantitatively reviewed 85 observations extracted from 41 studies to examine how both infection status and infection intensity are related to changes in body stores, refuelling rates, movement capacity, phenology and survival in migratory hosts across taxa. Overall, host infection status was weakly associated with reduced body stores, delayed migration and lower survival, and more strongly associated with reduced movement. Infection intensity was not associated with changes to host body stores, but was associated with moderate negative effects on movement, phenology and survival. In conclusion, we found evidence for negative effects of infection on host phenology and survival, but the effects were relatively small. This may have implications for the extent to which migratory separation and migratory culling act to limit parasite dispersal in migratory systems. We propose a number of recommendations for future research that will further advance our understanding of how migratory separation and migratory culling may shape host?parasite dynamics along migratory routes globally.","2017-12-13","2018-03-26 23:50:56","2018-04-17 05:14:19","2018-03-26 23:50:56","301-314","","1","87","","Journal of Animal Ecology","Migratory animals feel the cost of getting sick","","","","","","","","","","","","besjournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 067","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QR4TVBMN\Risely Alice et al. - 2017 - Migratory animals feel the cost of getting sick A.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9FXGHS8M\Infection-and-Migration-metaanalysis-v1.0.1.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3QYH92X8\jane12766-sup-0001-supinfo1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\G9DCKWTS\jane12766-sup-0002-supinfo2.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3DL2KYEW\1365-2656.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","disease ecology; host–pathogen dynamics; migratory culling; migratory separation; parasite ecology; pathogen dispersal; zoonoses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the major potential drivers of survival variation among juveniles is body mass. Heavy juveniles are better fed and have greater body reserves, and are thus assumed to survive better than light individuals. In spite of this, some studies have failed to detect an influence of body mass on offspring survival, questioning whether offspring body mass does indeed consistently influence juvenile survival, or whether this occurs in particular species/environments. Furthermore, the causes for variation in offspring mass are poorly understood, although maternal mass has often been reported to play a crucial role. To understand why offspring differ in body mass, and how this influences juvenile survival, we performed phylogenetically corrected meta?analyses of both the relationship between offspring body mass and offspring survival in birds and mammals and the relationship between maternal mass and offspring mass in mammals. We found strong support for an overall positive effect of offspring body mass on survival, with a more pronounced influence in mammals than in birds. An increase of one standard deviation of body mass increased the odds of offspring survival by 71% in mammals and by 44% in birds. A cost of being too fat in birds in terms of flight performance might explain why body mass is a less reliable predictor of offspring survival in birds. We then looked for moderators explaining the among?study differences reported in the intensity of this relationship. Surprisingly, sex did not influence the intensity of the offspring mass?survival relationship and phylogeny only accounted for a small proportion of observed variation in the intensity of that relationship. Among the potential factors that might affect the relationship between mass and survival in juveniles, only environmental conditions was influential in mammals. Offspring survival was most strongly influenced by body mass in captive populations and wild populations in the absence of predation. We also found support for the expected positive effect of maternal mass on offspring mass in mammals (rpearson?=?0.387). As body mass is a strong predictor of early survival, we expected heavier mothers to allocate more to their offspring, leading them to be heavier and so to have a higher survival. However, none of the potential factors we tested for variation in the maternal mass?offspring mass relationship had a detectable influence. Further studies should focus on linking these two relationships to determine whether a strong effect of offspring size on early survival is associated with a high correlation coefficient between maternal mass and offspring mass.","2017-04-09","2018-03-27 00:10:24","2018-04-17 05:15:09","2018-03-27 00:10:24","1-27","","1","93","","Biological Reviews","Causes and consequences of variation in offspring body mass","","","","","","","","","","","","onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 068","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KLIUA3ZJ\brv12329-sup-0001-appendixs1.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QGXV3PLJ\brv12329-sup-0002-appendixs2.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2PJBYVBN\brv12329-sup-0003-appendixs3.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6TVFKBSJ\brv12329-sup-0004-appendixs4.r; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7WYUJ6TX\Ronget Victor et al. - 2017 - Causes and consequences of variation in offspring .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3TJ3J2WE\brv.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","body size; early survival; individual heterogeneity; maternal allocation; maternal size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Community?level studies provide an integrative assessment of invasion impacts and insights into factors that influence the vulnerability of different native species. We investigated effects of the nonnative herb Lythrum salicaria on pollination of native species in 14 fens of the eastern United States. We compared visitors per flower for 122 native plant species in invaded and uninvaded fens and incorporated a landscape?scale experiment, removing L. salicaria flowers from three of the invaded fens. Total flower densities were more than three times higher in invaded than uninvaded or removal sites when L. salicaria was blooming. Despite an increase in number of visitors with number of flowers per area, visitors per native flower declined with increasing numbers of flowers. Therefore, L. salicaria invasion depressed visitation to native flowers. In removal sites, visitation to native flowers was similar to uninvaded sites, confirming the observational results and also suggesting that invasion had not generated a persistent build?up of visitor populations. To study species?level impacts, we examined effects of invasion on visitors per flower for the 36 plant species flowering in both invaded and uninvaded fens. On average, the effect of invasion represented about a 20% reduction in visits per flower. We measured the influence of plant traits on vulnerability to L. salicaria invasion using meta?analysis. Bilaterally symmetrical flowers experienced stronger impacts on visitation, and similarity in flower color to L. salicaria weakly intensified competition with the invader for visitors. Finally, we assessed the reproductive consequences of competition with the invader in a dominant flowering shrub, Dasiphora fruticosa. Despite the negative effect of invasion on pollinator visitation in this species, pollen limitation of seed production was not stronger in invaded than in uninvaded sites, suggesting little impact of competition for pollinators on its population demography. Negative effects on pollination of native plants by this copiously flowering invader appeared to be mediated by increases in total flower density that were not matched by increases in pollinator density. The strength of impact was modulated across native species by their floral traits and reproductive ecology.","2017-01-03","2018-03-27 00:33:03","2018-04-17 05:16:06","2018-03-27 00:33:03","57-69","","1","98","","Ecology","Invasion of a dominant floral resource","","","","","","","","","","","","esajournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 070","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HLV6CM86\ecy1639-sup-0001-appendixs1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GSSVZZ8K\ecy1639-sup-0002-appendixs2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PTBKZXMG\ecy1639-sup-0003-appendixs3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\54LEUJDS\ecy1639-sup-0004-appendixs4.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JCBMMB8I\ecy1639-sup-0005-appendixs5.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9XZ38PMI\ecy1639-sup-0006-appendixs6.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\L7MLZ76R\ecy1639-sup-0007-appendixs7.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GTPQ5U4M\ecy1639-sup-0008-appendixs8.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9Z2H38HL\ecy1639-sup-0009-appendixs9.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B2B63DXM\ecy1639-sup-0010-appendixs10.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HBKVH7YZ\ecy1639-sup-0011-datas1.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TXYNKIAP\ecy1639-sup-0012-metadatas1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HKPVQGJF\Goodell Karen and Parker Ingrid M. - 2017 - Invasion of a dominant floral resource effects on.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6KWEWKVI\ecy.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","indirect interactions; alien plants; competition for pollinators; floral traits; flower density; Lythrum salicaria; morphological similarity; nonnative plant; pollen limitation; pollinator visitation; purple loosestrife; trait‐based analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite a wealth of research on how animals respond to anthropogenic changes to natural wetlands and how they use created wetlands, we lack a broad synthesis of these data. While some altered wetlands may provide vital habitat, others could pose a considerable risk to wildlife. This risk will be heightened if such wetlands are ecological traps ? preferred habitats that confer lower fitness than another available habitat. Wetlands functioning as ecological traps could decrease both local and regional population persistence, and ultimately lead to extinctions. Most studies have examined how animals respond to changes in environmental conditions by measuring responses at the community and population levels, but studying ecological traps requires information on fitness and habitat preferences. Our current lack of knowledge of individual?level responses may therefore limit our capacity to manage wetland ecosystems effectively since ecological traps require different management practices to mitigate potential consequences. We conducted a global meta?analysis to characterise how animals respond to four key drivers of wetland alteration: agriculture, mining, restoration and urbanisation. Our overarching goal was to evaluate the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems, as well as identify current knowledge gaps that limit both the current understanding of these responses and effective wetland management. We extracted 1799 taxon?specific response ratios from 271 studies across 29 countries. Community? (e.g. richness) and population?level (e.g. density) measures within altered wetlands were largely comparable to those within reference wetlands. By contrast, individual fitness measures (e.g. survival) were often lower, highlighting the potential limitations of using only community? and population?level measures to assess habitat quality. Only four studies provided habitat?preference data, preventing investigation of the potential for altered wetlands to function as ecological traps. This is concerning because attempts to identify ecological traps may detect previously unidentified conservation risks. Although there was considerable variability amongst taxa, amphibians were typically the most sensitive taxon, and thus, may be a valuable bio?indicator of wetland quality. Despite suffering reduced survival and reproduction, measures such as time to and mass at metamorphosis were similar between altered and reference wetlands, suggesting that quantifying metamorphosis?related measures in isolation may not provide accurate information on habitat quality. Our review provides the most detailed evaluation to date of the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems. We emphasise that the role of wetlands in human?altered ecosystems can be complex, as they may represent important habitat but also pose potential risks to animals. Reduced availability of natural wetlands is increasing the importance of altered wetlands for aquatic animals. Consequently, we need to define what represents habitat quality from the perspective of animals, and gain a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of habitat selection and how these factors could be manipulated. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the quality of these wetlands should be implemented to maximise their conservation potential.","2017-09-19","2018-03-27 00:44:04","2018-04-17 05:16:44","2018-03-27 00:44:04","529-554","","1","93","","Biological Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 071","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9FDSX8X4\brv12358-sup-0001-appendixs1.xls; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4MYYZCDE\brv12358-sup-0002-appendixs2_ms.r; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6Z92RXAD\brv12358-sup-0003-figs1.tif; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VW246X83\brv12358-sup-0004-figs2.tif; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CFTZ7NF9\brv12358-sup-0005-tables1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JM96J3A7\Sievers Michael et al. - 2017 - Impacts of human‐induced environmental change in w.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Z3FB8SYS\MA071_Fig3_data_from_WebPlotDigitiser.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9ERBFZXK\MA071_Fig3.png; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NX4HZLTF\brv.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","restoration; agriculture; ecological trap; habitat; habitat management; HIREC; human‐induced rapid environmental change; mining; urbanisation; wildlife","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What is often overlooked is how results from controlled conditions translate back to field situations. A meta?analysis showed that lab?grown plants had faster growth rates, higher nitrogen concentrations and different morphology. They remained smaller, however, because the lab plants had grown for a much shorter time. We compared glasshouse and growth chamber conditions with those in the field and found that the ratio between the daily amount of light and daily temperature (photothermal ratio) was consistently lower under controlled conditions. This may strongly affect a plant's source : sink ratio and hence its overall morphology and physiology. Plants in the field also grow at higher plant densities. A second meta?analysis showed that a doubling in density leads on average to 34% smaller plants with strong negative effects on tiller or side?shoot formation but little effect on plant height. We found the r2 between lab and field phenotypic data to be rather modest (0.26). Based on these insights, we discuss various alternatives to facilitate the translation from lab results to the field, including several options to apply growth regimes closer to field conditions.","2016-10-26","2018-03-28 02:09:58","2018-03-28 02:12:57","2018-03-28 02:09:58","838-855","","4","212","","New Phytologist","Pampered inside, pestered outside?","","","","","","","","","","","","nph-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 075","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B3WPI5IG\Poorter Hendrik et al. - 2016 - Pampered inside, pestered outside Differences and.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4T4ADBHH\nph14243-sup-0001-tabless1-s6.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2EE3SDCU\nph.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","daily light integral (DLI); glasshouse; growth chamber; photothermal ratio; plant density; plant growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Model systems, such as amphibian metamorphosis, which can be generalized across many types of environmental change and across many species, are a powerful tool for understanding mechanisms that facilitate persistence in altered and disturbed environments. Amphibian larvae respond to environmental change by varying age at metamorphosis, or size at metamorphosis. Differential selection pressures on age or size at metamorphosis may result in a differential response among taxa to environmental change. Using a meta?analysis, we investigated whether age at metamorphosis, size at metamorphosis, and larval growth rate vary within and among taxonomic families of amphibians in experiments that modified the environmental temperature, density of individuals, food, hydroperiod and the presence of predators. For all environmental factors except predators, the direction of the response was consistent across most of the studied taxa. However, there was considerable variation in effect size both within and among families. Results demonstrate that amphibian metamorphosis is a valuable model system for studying the effects of environmental change. Yet, we stress the need for caution in making generalizations about how individuals respond to environmental factors that have an indirect effect on physiology and require the perception of an environmental cue, such as the presence of predators. Synthesis As the current conditions of the environment are rapidly changing there is a need to understand how organisms respond to environmental change, and whether response of one species can be generalized to other species. Using a meta?analyses, we tested whether the phenotypic response of amphibian larvae to five types of environmental change is consistent among and within taxonomic families. The phenotypic response to changes in environmental factors was consistent when the environmental factor has a direct effect on physiology, but varies among and within family if the environmental factor has an indirect effect on physiology or requires the perception of an environmental cue.","2016-09-19","2018-03-28 06:34:05","2018-03-28 06:35:29","2018-03-28 06:34:05","1700-1711","","12","125","","Oikos","","","","","","","","","","","","","onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 076","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZQHK4967\Edge_etal_Oikos2016_Data.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\82CMFVW3\Edge_etal_Oikos2016_DataSources.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WGABGMXM\Edge Christopher B. et al. - 2016 - The response of amphibian larvae to environmental .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VVWAEAHV\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IGP communities composed of intraguild predators and prey have been well studied; however, we know less about IGP communities composed of predators, pathogens, and resources. Resource quality plays an important role in community dynamics and may influence IGP dynamics as well. We conducted a meta?analysis on predator?pathogen?resource communities to determine whether resource quality mediated by the pathogen affected predator life?history traits and if these effects met the theoretical constraints of IGP communities. To do this, we summarized results from studies that investigated the use of predators and pathogens to control insect pests. In these systems, the predators are the IGPred and pathogens are the IGPrey. We found that consumer longevity, fecundity, and survival decreased by 26%, 31% and 13% respectively, when predators consumed pathogen?infected prey, making the infected prey a low quality resource. Predators also significantly preferred healthy prey over infected prey. When we divided consumers by enemy type, strict predators (e.g. wolf spiders) had no preference while parasitoids preferred healthy prey. Our results suggest that communities containing parasitoids and pathogens may rarely exhibit intraguild predation; whereas, communities composed of strict predators and pathogens are more likely dominated by IGP dynamics. In these latter communities, the consumption of low and high quality resources suggests that IGP communities composed of strict predators, pathogens and prey should naturally persist, supporting IGP theory. Synthesis We investigated how consuming pathogen?infected prey influence important life?history parameters of insect predators. Pathogens are used in a variety of biocontrol programs, especially to control crop pests. We found that true predators (i.e. wolf spiders) have no preference for healthy or infected prey and have reduced fecundity, survival and longevity consuming infected prey. However, parasitoids avoided infected prey when possible. In biocontrol programs with multiple control agents, parasitoids and pathogens would do a better job controlling pests as predators would reduce the amount of pathogen available and have reduced fitness from consuming infected prey. However, theory suggests that true predators, prey and pathogens may coexist long term.","2016-11-02","2018-03-28 07:13:27","2018-03-28 07:21:39","2018-03-28 07:13:27","1554-1560","","11","125","","Oikos","The negative effects of pathogen‐infected prey on predators","","","","","","","","","","","","onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 080","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PED4C4SS\Flick MetaAnalysis Data.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PC5NUD5G\Flick Andrew J. et al. - 2016 - The negative effects of pathogen‐infected prey on .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Q5YIP9KF\oik-03458.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JFPUZENB\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the ecological and economic importance of wild bees and the fact that several species are now managed for pollination services worldwide, little is known about how land use and beekeeping practices jointly influence gene flow. Using stingless bees as a model system, containing wild and managed species that are presumed to be particularly susceptible to habitat degradation, here we examine the main drivers of tropical bee gene flow. We employ a novel landscape genetic approach to analyse data from 135 populations of 17 stingless bee species distributed across diverse tropical biomes within the Americas. Our work has important methodological implications, as we illustrate how a maximum?likelihood approach can be applied in a meta?analysis framework to account for multiple factors, and weight estimates by sample size. In contrast to previously held beliefs, gene flow was not related to body size or deforestation, and isolation by geographic distance (IBD) was significantly affected by management, with managed species exhibiting a weaker IBD than wild ones. Our study thus reveals the critical importance of beekeeping practices in shaping the patterns of genetic differentiation across bee species. Additionally, our results show that many stingless bee species maintain high gene flow across heterogeneous landscapes. We suggest that future efforts to preserve wild tropical bees should focus on regulating beekeeping practices to maintain natural gene flow and enhancing pollinator?friendly habitats, prioritizing species showing a limited dispersal ability.","2016-09-23","2018-03-28 07:22:48","2018-03-28 07:25:49","2018-03-28 07:22:48","5345-5358","","21","25","","Molecular Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 081","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8CLDYGC3\Jaffé Rodolfo et al. - 2016 - Beekeeping practices and geographic distance, not .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NL8ZWXTT\mec13852-sup-0001-tables1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YNI4YS8B\mec13852-sup-0002-appendixs1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VG3YN62I\mec13852-sup-0003-appendixs2.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A2CVKV5G\mec13852-sup-0004-appendixs3.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MHWGFVTL\mec13852-sup-0005-appendixs4.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\F454VJSJ\mec13852-sup-0006-datas1.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AHEGSPBK\mec.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","dispersal; pollination; beekeeping; land use; landscape genetics; stingless bees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Proportional (isometric) scaling, where large and small individuals are magnified versions of each other, is often assumed to be the most common way morphological traits scale relative to overall size within species. However, the many traits showing nonproportional (allometric) scaling have motivated some of the most discussed hypotheses on scaling relationships in biology, like the positive allometry hypothesis for secondary sexual traits and the negative allometry hypothesis for genitals. I evaluate more than 3,200 allometric parameters from the literature and find that negative allometry, not isometry, is the expected scaling relationship of morphological traits within species. Slopes of secondary sexual traits are more often steeper compared with other traits, but slopes larger than unity are also common for traits not under sexual selection. The steepness of the allometric slope is accordingly a weak predictor of past and present patterns of selection. Scaling of genitals varies across taxonomic groups, but negative allometry of genitals in insects and spiders is a consistent pattern. Finally, I find indications that terrestrial organisms may have a different scaling of morphological traits overall compared with aquatic species.","2015-11-20","2018-04-17 06:47:49","2021-03-10 06:53:23","2018-04-17 06:47:49","89-98","","1","187","","The American Naturalist","","","","","","","","","","","","","www-journals-uchicago-edu.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 191","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\88HSAWEN\allometry_data.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6TZ4IEYE\Voje - 2015 - Scaling of Morphological Characters across Trait T.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P5G779K2\R_script.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VJ5XWP8P\684159.html; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2VDMKURL\Table_S1.zip","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dendrochronological analyses, based on the counting, crossdating and characterisation of incrementally formed wood rings, offer powerful insights for diverse fields including ecology, climatology and archaeology. The application of this toolset is likely to increase in popularity over coming decades due to advances in the field and a reduction in the cost of analyses. In research settings where the continued value of living trees subject to dendrochronological investigation is important, the use of an increment bore corer to extract trunk tissue is considered the best option to minimise negative impacts on tree health (e.g. stress and fitness). A small and fragmented body of literature, however, reports significant after-effects, and in some cases fatal outcomes, from this sampling technique. As it stands, the literature documenting increment bore coring (IBC) impacts lacks experimental consistency and is poorly replicated, making it difficult for prospective users of the method to assess likely tree responses to coring. This paucity of information has the potential to lead to destructive misuse of the method and also limits its safe implementation in circumstances where the risk of impacts may be appropriate. If IBC is to fulfil its potential as a method of choice across research fields, then we must first address our limited understanding of IBC impacts and provide a framework for its appropriate future use. Firstly, we review the historical context of studies examining the impacts of IBC on trees to identify known patterns, focal issues and biases in existing knowledge. IBC wound responses, particularly those that impact on lumber quality, have been the primary focus of prior studies. No universal treatment was identified that conclusively improved wound healing and few studies have linked wound responses to tree health impacts. Secondly, we build on literature insights using a theoretical approach to identify the most important factors to guide future research involving implementation of IBC, including innate tree characteristics and environmental factors. Thirdly, we synthesise and interrogate the quantitative data available through meta-analysis to identify risk factors for wound reactions. Although poor reporting standards, restricted scopes and a bias towards temperate ecosystems limited quantitative insight, we found that complete cambial wound closure could still harbour high rates of internal trunk decay, and that conditions favouring faster growth generally correlated with reduced indices of internal and external damage in broadleaved taxa. Finally, we propose a framework for guiding best-practice application of IBC to address knowledge gaps and maximise the utility of this method, including standardised reporting indices for identifying and minimising negative impacts on tree health. While IBC is an underutilised tool of ecological enquiry with broad applicability, the method will always incur some risk of negative impacts on the cored tree. We caution that the decision to core, or not to core, must be given careful consideration on a case-by-case basis. In time, we are confident that this choice will be better informed by evidence-based insight.","2016-11-01","2018-05-22 01:16:05","2018-05-22 01:17:02","2018-05-22 01:16:05","899-924","","4","91","","","To core, or not to core","","","","","","","en","© 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 082","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7X4GRE95\brv12200-sup-0001-appendixs1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EYEGWMTS\brv12200-sup-0001-appendixs2.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MTUXY8E6\brv12200-sup-0001-appendixs3.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2JEJW8W4\brv12200-sup-0001-appendixs4.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J5G2CVEF\brv12200-sup-0001-appendixs5.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FP8SSLEV\Tsen et al. - 2016 - To core, or not to core the impact of coring on t.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5K2TDLCH\brv.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","age estimation; CODIT; crossdating; heartwood extraction; increment bore corer; plant disease risk; plant fitness; tropical trees; trunk decay; wound response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four plant functional types were parameterized on the basis of meta-analysis of plant hydraulic traits. Simulations from both the original and the updated ED2 were evaluated against 5 yr of field data from a Costa Rican SDTF site and remote-sensing data over Central America. The updated model generated realistic plant hydraulic dynamics, such as leaf water potential and stem sap flow. Compared with the original ED2, predictions from our novel trait-driven model matched better with observed growth, phenology and their variations among functional groups. Most notably, the original ED2 produced unrealistically small leaf area index (LAI) and underestimated cumulative leaf litter. Both of these biases were corrected by the updated model. The updated model was also better able to simulate spatial patterns of LAI dynamics in Central America. Plant hydraulic traits are intercorrelated in SDTFs.

In lakes, macrophytes stabilize clear-water conditions with high biodiversity and their decline can cause a shift to a turbid state with lower biodiversity. Various mechanisms have been suggested as triggers of macrophyte collapse. Herbivory by waterfowl and fish seems to be one of the obvious factors, but the response of macrophytes to herbivory is ambiguous. We hypothesized that herbivory alone does not typically cause macrophyte collapse, but that shading from periphyton can enhance the effect of herbivores. Shading of macrophytes is supposed to increase with eutrophication due to changes in the top–down control cascading from fish via macroinvertebrates to periphyton. We elaborated on this idea by fitting a macrophyte growth model with different herbivore grazing and periphyton shading scenarios. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis on existing experimental herbivore exclosure studies with respect to periphyton growth. The model supported our proposed hypothesis and the reviewed field studies appeared to point in the same direction. We suggest that a significant herbivore impact may indicate a reduced resilience of vegetation to eutrophication, making it an early warning signal for an imminent macrophyte collapse leading to a sudden shift of the system to turbid conditions.","2016-10-01","2018-05-22 05:08:49","2018-05-22 05:09:33","2018-05-22 05:08:49","1489-1495","","10","125","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2016 The Authors","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 093","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EYC5KTMI\Hidding et al. - 2016 - Synergy between shading and herbivory triggers mac.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JFJNYJHI\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We perform a meta-analysis of 72 large published food webs to investigate their trophic diversity structure and possible endogenous, exogenous, and methodological causal variables. Consistent with classic theory, we found that published food webs can generally be described as ‘pyramids of species richness’. The food webs were more predator-poor, prey-rich and hierarchical than is expected by chance or by the niche or cascade models. The trophic species richness distribution also depended on centrality, latitude, ecosystem-type and methodological bias. Although trophic diversity structure is generally pyramidal, under many conditions the structure is consistently uniform or inverse-pyramidal. Our meta-analysis adds nuance to classic assumptions about food web structure: diversity decreases with trophic level, but not under all conditions, and the decrease may be scale-dependent. Synthesis The distribution of species richness across trophic levels has not been evaluated in recent decades, despite improvement in food web resolution and the relevance of biodiversity distribution to ecosystem function. Our meta-analysis of 72 large, recent food webs, illustrates that published food webs can generally be described as basal-rich, top-poor ‘pyramids of species richness’, consistent with classic theory. Although trophic diversity structure is generally pyramidal, under some environmental and ecological conditions the structure is uniform or inverse-pyramidal.

In this paper, I assembled 29 studies and conducted a meta-regression to determine the importance of invertebrate herbivores to population growth rates (λ) while accounting for missing data. I found that invertebrate herbivory often induced important reductions in plant population growth rates (with herbivory, λ was 1.08 ± 0.36; without herbivory, λ was 1.28 ± 0.58). This relationship tended to be weaker for seed predation than for other types of herbivory, except when seed predation rates were very high. Even so, the amount by which studies reduced herbivory was a poor predictor of differences in population growth rates—which strongly cautions against using measured herbivory rates as a proxy for the impact of herbivores. Herbivory reduced plant population growth rates significantly more when potential growth rates were high, which helps to explain why there was less variation in actual population growth rates than in potential population growth rates. The synthesis of these studies also shows the need for future studies to report variance in estimates of λ and to quantify how λ varies as a function of plant density.","2016-09-01","2018-05-23 08:36:41","2018-05-23 08:37:25","2018-05-23 08:36:41","43-53","","1","182","","Oecologia","The effects of invertebrate herbivores on plant population growth","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 097","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YU23PNSK\442_2016_3602_MOESM1_ESM.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UCIINT4L\Katz - 2016 - The effects of invertebrate herbivores on plant po.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7SVZ6DPT\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing meta-analyses suggest an overall positive effect of vertebrate gut passage on seed germination, but no significant effects for non-flying mammals. However, previous meta-analyses combined rodents (seed predators) and primates (seed dispersers) into the non-flying mammals category, which may confound specific effects of each group on seed germination. However positive effects of monkeys on germination had previously been found in some studies. Here we disentangle the role of Neotropical primates as contributors to seed dispersal in tropical forests by running a meta-analysis to determine the overall magnitude of gut passage effects on seed germination percentage and mean time to germination. We also compare effect sizes as a function of different feeding guilds, gut complexities, and seed size. Our results show a strong, positive effect of primates on seed germination percentage and on the number of days to first germination. Strictly frugivorous monkeys, the group most threatened by extinction, showed the highest dispersal quality, increasing germination percentage by 75%. Primates that include insects in their diets had no average effect on germination percentage or time. Gut passage had different outcomes on seeds with different sizes; both large and small seeds showed similar increases in germination percentages after gut passage, but only large seeds germinated faster than control seeds after gut passage. Our results show a relevant role for primates in providing high seed dispersal quality and as drivers of forest regeneration. The combined effects of defaunation and forest fragmentation may result in decreased regeneration of trees, which has the potential to affect negatively both forest structure and ecosystem processes. Finally, we provide general guidelines for standardizing research on seed dispersal by primates. Synthesis Consuming fleshy fruits and dispersing seeds is the main ecological service provided by vertebrates to plants. Vertebrate increases seed germination due to treatment given during digestive system passage. Previous meta-analyses suggest an overall positive effect of vertebrate gut passage on germination, but no insights are available on its variation among different functional groups of mammals. Our analyses indicated that gut passage by Neotropical primates increased seed germination. Strict frugivores, the ones most threatened by extinction, were the most efficient. Our results show a relevant role for primates in providing high seed dispersal quality and as drivers of forest regeneration, which can be meaningful for conservation in a community scale.","2016-08-01","2018-05-23 08:41:25","2018-05-23 08:41:58","2018-05-23 08:41:25","1069-1080","","8","125","","","How do primates affect seed germination?","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 098","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\R6GW9UF2\Fuzessy et al. - 2016 - How do primates affect seed germination A meta-an.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\T6JWRKFB\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our goal in this study was to quantify the effects of invasive plants on butterfly and moth communities. In addition, we sought to elucidate the fitness consequences of non-native hosts on lepidopterans. We conducted a meta-analysis on a total of 76 studies which provided data on larval performance, survival, oviposition preference, abundance, and species richness of Lepidoptera on native and exotic plants. Overwhelmingly, we found that performance and survival were reduced for larvae developing on exotic hosts, relative to native hosts. At the community level, alien plant invasion was associated with a reduction in the overall abundance and richness of lepidopteran communities. We found that lepidopterans did not show strong oviposition preference for native hosts. This result suggests that many invasive plant species may decrease lepidopteran abundance by providing a target for oviposition where larvae have a relatively poor chance of survival. Among studies that tested both survival and preference on exotic hosts, 37.5 % found evidence for novel hosts that could function as ecological traps (the figure was 18 % when considering studies that only assayed larval performance). Thus, although the majority of novel hosts included in our analyses are not likely to act as ecological traps, the potential clearly exists for this effect, and the role of ecological traps should be considered along with other aspects of global change impacting natural communities.","2016-08-01","2018-05-23 08:50:24","2018-05-23 08:51:09","2018-05-23 08:50:24","985-996","","4","181","","Oecologia","Consequences of exotic host use","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 100","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\376PHAAH\442_2016_3560_MOESM1_ESM.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SGEE5JAK\442_2016_3560_MOESM2_ESM.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FRRHFCWS\442_2016_3560_MOESM3_ESM.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6ZNI538R\Yoon and Read - 2016 - Consequences of exotic host use impacts on Lepido.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XZNNFJVD\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human disturbance comprises anthropogenic activities that are typically non-lethal, but may cause short- and/or longer-term stress and fitness responses in wildlife. Expanding human activity in the Antarctic region is of particular concern because it increases the scope and potential for increased human disturbance to wildlife in a region that is often thought of as relatively untouched by anthropogenic influences. Here, we use a meta-analytical approach to synthesise research on human disturbance to wildlife over the last three decades in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic region. We combine data from 62 studies across 21 species on the behavioural, physiological and population responses of wildlife to pedestrian, vehicle and research disturbances. The overall effect size indicated a small, albeit statistically significant negative effect of disturbance (−0.39; 95% CI: −0.60 to −0.18). Negative effects were found for both physiological and population responses, but no evidence was found for a significant impact on wildlife behavioural responses. Negative effects were found across pedestrian, vehicle and research disturbances. Significant and high among-study heterogeneity was found in both disturbance and response sub-groups. Among species, it remains unclear to what extent different forms of disturbance translate into negative population responses. Most current guidelines to limit wildlife disturbance impacts in Antarctica recommend that approaches be tailored to animal behavioural cues, but our work demonstrates that behavioural changes do not necessarily reflect more cryptic, and more deleterious impacts, such as changes in physiology. In consequence, we recommend that pedestrian approach guidelines in the Antarctic region be revisited. Due to the high heterogeneity in effects, management guidelines for different sites and species will need to be developed on a case-by-case basis, ideally in conjunction with carefully designed experiments. Guidelines to reduce the impact of research activities per se require development to reduce the potential impacts of conducting research. We identify research questions that, if answered, will further improve the evidence base for guidelines to manage human disturbance in Antarctica.","2016-08","2018-06-06 07:13:54","2018-06-06 07:15:07","2018-06-06 07:13:54","578-596","","3","91","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 101","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\R7ETZEZS\brv12184-sup-0001-appendixs1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EJY42LTV\brv12184-sup-0002-appendixs2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7B9BAST3\brv12184-sup-0003-appendixs3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\REX6SLCG\brv12184-sup-0004-figures1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2TFFRW34\brv12184-sup-0005-figures2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6TFUJAQ3\Coetzee and Chown - A meta-analysis of human disturbance impacts on An.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Q6AWG8JS\brv.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","systematic review; Antarctic conservation; Antarctic policy; conservation evidence; human disturbance impacts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The composition of bacterial communities followed dissimilar patterns between hemispheres, as the Southern and Northern Hemispheres were dominated by Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, respectively. However, Proteobacteria was co-dominant in both hemispheres. Moreover, we found a decrease in soil bacterial diversity with altitude. Climatic features (e.g., high diurnal temperature range and low temperature) were correlated with the lower diversity found at high elevations, but geographical gradients in soil total carbon and species turnover were important drivers of the observed latitudinal patterns. We thus found both parallels and differences in the biogeographical patterns of aboveground vs. soil bacterial diversity. Our findings support previous studies that highlighted soil pH, spatial influence, and organic matter as important drivers of bacterial diversity and composition. Furthermore, our results provide a novel integrative view of how climate and soil factors influence soil bacterial diversity at the global scale, which is critical to improve ecosystem and earth system simulation models and for formulating sustainable ecosystem management and conservation policies.","2016-08","2018-06-07 06:31:09","2018-06-07 06:32:42","2018-06-07 06:31:09","373-390","","3","86","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 106","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MGGX4F96\DelgadoBaquerizo_etal_2016.xls; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FSDAAU3R\ecm1216-sup-0001-appendixs1.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\32BWSZF5\Delgado‐Baquerizo et al. - Carbon content and climate variability drive globa.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MTLANJN2\ecm.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","biodiversity; bacterial composition; diurnal temperature range; global biogeography; terrestrial ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Synthesis For invasive plants that spread across a wide distributional range, understanding the mechanisms that allow rapid colonization and spread is crucial. Phenotypic plasticity (PLA) and local genetic variation (LOC) are both believed to play important roles in promoting range expansion. However, it is not clear which mechanism, PLA or LOC, contributes more to this process. According to our meta–analysis, PLA explained a higher proportion of adaptive phenotypic variation in most cases. Nevertheless, the predominance of an expansion mechanism depends on species characteristics and the trait studied. PLA may benefit from LOC to some extent. We suggest that the contribution of PLA to range expansion may better explain plant invasion success than the level of PLA itself.","2016-07","2018-06-08 08:27:12","2018-06-08 08:28:13","2018-06-08 08:27:12","905-917","","7","125","","","How much do phenotypic plasticity and local genetic variation contribute to phenotypic divergences along environmental gradients in widespread invasive plants?","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 109","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\APYXE5AB\Data file-OIKOS02372.R2.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Q9JBDGSE\Liao et al. - How much do phenotypic plasticity and local geneti.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HE83ZCFY\oik-02372.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UXP29LT7\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amphibians are strongly influenced by climate change, but we do not have a clear picture of how climate influences important parameters of amphibian populations, such as abundance, survival, breeding success and morphology. Furthermore, the relative impact of temperature and precipitation change remains underappreciated. We used Bayesian meta-analysis and meta-regression to quantify the impact of temperature and precipitation change on amphibian phenology, abundance, individual features and performance. We obtained effect sizes from studies performed in five continents. Temperature increase was the major driver of phenological advancement, while the impact of precipitation on phenology was weak. Conversely, population dynamics was mostly determined by precipitation: negative trends were associated with drying regimes. The impact of precipitation on abundance was particularly strong in tropical areas, while the importance of temperature was feeble. Both temperature and precipitation influenced parameters representing breeding performance, morphology, developmental rate and survival, but the response was highly heterogeneous among species. For instance, warming temperature increased body size in some species, and decreased size in others. Similarly, rainy periods increased survival of some species and reduced the survival of others. Our study showed contrasting impacts of temperature and precipitation changes on amphibian populations. Both climatic parameters strongly influenced amphibian performance, but temperature was the major determinant of the phenological changes, while precipitation had the major role on population dynamics, with alarming declines associated with drying trends.","2016-07-01","2018-06-13 02:06:20","2018-06-13 02:06:50","2018-06-13 02:06:20","683-693","","3","181","","Oecologia","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 112","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NV83JBIP\442_2016_3610_MOESM1_ESM.xls; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QBEP569Z\442_2016_3610_MOESM2_ESM.pptx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7AYCTRFA\Ficetola and Maiorano - 2016 - Contrasting effects of temperature and precipitati.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7FCHE3LS\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results indicate that sex, early life conditions (brood size and juvenile body size), the number of stimuli, type of stimuli (constructed from zebra finch song elements or human speech syllables) and type of discrimination (based on phonetic characteristics or sequential structure of sounds) significantly influenced learning speed. Learning speed was faster if birds were female, reared in larger broods or were larger as juveniles. Greater numbers of stimuli and human speech-based stimuli were harder to learn than fewer stimuli and stimuli consisting of zebra finch song elements. Stimuli differing in phonetic characteristics were learned faster than those varying in structure.

Meta-analyses that focus on identifying generalisations in a single taxon are also valuable because species in a taxon are more likely to share similar unique constraints. We conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic meta-analysis of flight initiation distance in lizards. Flight initiation distance (FID) is a common metric used to quantify risk-taking and has previously been shown to reflect adaptive decision-making. The past decade has seen an explosion of studies focused on quantifying FID in lizards, and, because lizards occur in a wide range of habitats, are ecologically diverse, and are typically smaller and differ physiologically from the better studied mammals and birds, they are worthy of detailed examination. We found that variables that reflect the costs or benefits of flight (being engaged in social interactions, having food available) as well as certain predator effects (predator size and approach speed) had large effects on FID in the directions predicted by optimal escape theory. Variables that were associated with morphology (with the exception of crypsis) and physiology had relatively small effects, whereas habitat selection factors typically had moderate to large effect sizes.

Although this hypothesis has provided a useful framework for understanding the evolution of plant chemical defense, there are many inconsistencies surrounding associated predictions, and it has been heavily criticized and deemed obsolete. We used a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis model to test whether defenses from apparent and unapparent plants differ in their effects on herbivores. We collected a total of 225 effect sizes from 158 published papers in which the effects of plant chemistry on herbivore performance were reported. As predicted by the plant-apparency hypothesis, we found a prevalence of quantitative defenses in woody plants and qualitative defenses in herbaceous plants. However, the detrimental impacts of qualitative defenses were more effective against specialists than generalists, and the effects of chemical defenses did not significantly differ between specialists and generalists for woody or herbaceous plants. A striking pattern that emerged from our data was a pervasiveness of beneficial effects of secondary metabolites on herbivore performance, especially generalists. This pattern provides evidence that herbivores are evolving effective counteradaptations to putative plant defenses.","2016-05","2018-06-13 07:46:34","2018-06-13 07:48:04","2018-06-13 07:46:34","1044-1057","","3","210","","","Does plant apparency matter?","","","","","","","en","© 2016 The Authors.

Prey are often vulnerable to predation during this transition, facing a predator gauntlet as they leave their source ecosystem. As a result of predation during this transition, predators may have stronger effects on prey fluxes to the neighboring ecosystem than on prey densities in the predator’s own ecosystem. I used meta-analysis of predator (fish) and prey (invertebrate) interactions in freshwater ecosystems to test the hypothesis that fish have stronger effects on prey flux to the terrestrial ecosystem, by reducing insect emergence biomass, than on prey densities in the aquatic ecosystem, by reducing benthic insect/invertebrate biomass. Fish reduced insect emergence by 39 % on average, more than twice as strong as their reductions of benthic prey (16 % reduction; averages are variance-weighted). In fact, fish effects on benthic prey were not significantly different from zero, but were significant for emergence. These results indicate that predator effects can not only cascade from one ecosystem to another but also that effects can be stronger outside than within the ecosystem of the predator. Failure to account for this may underestimate the effects of predators on prey.","2016-04-01","2018-06-13 08:00:09","2018-06-13 08:02:04","2018-06-13 08:00:09","1205-1211","","4","180","","Oecologia","Contrasting effects of fish predation on benthic versus emerging prey","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 121","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9TP88HRM\442_2015_3539_MOESM1_ESM.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\67YQID2P\442_2015_3539_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ANB5LVLY\Wesner - 2016 - Contrasting effects of fish predation on benthic v.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DS3VGDJQ\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated divergence in offspring size, offspring number, and the trade-off between these traits using a meta-analysis in livebearing fishes (Poeciliidae). Life-history divergence was consistent and predictable to some (predation, hydrogen sulphide) but not all (density, food limitation, salinity) selective agents. In contrast, magnitudes of divergence among selective agents were similar. Finally, there was a negative, asymmetric relationship between offspring-number and offspring-size divergence, suggesting greater costs of increasing offspring size than number.

We tested three hypotheses that use eco-evolutionary theory to predict volatile induction: feeding guild (chewing arthropods > sap feeders), diet breadth (specialist herbivores > generalists), and selection history (domesticated plants < wild species). To test these hypotheses, we extracted data from 236 experiments that report volatiles produced by herbivore-damaged and undamaged plants. These data were subjected to meta-analysis, including effects on total volatiles and major biochemical classes. Overall, we found that chewers induced more volatiles than sap feeders, for both total volatiles and most volatile classes (e.g. green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes). Although specialist herbivores induced more total volatiles than generalists, this was inconsistent across chemical classes. Contrary to our expectation, domesticated species induced stronger volatile responses than wild species, even when controlling for plant taxonomy. Surprisingly, this is the first quantitative synthesis of published studies on HIPVs. Our analysis provides support for perceptions in the published literature (chewers > sap feeders), while challenging other commonly held notions (wild > crop).

With the development of molecular genetic techniques in the late 20th century and the sequencing technologies that followed, biologists are now able to identify genetic variants and directly relate them to organismal fitness. We reviewed the literature for published estimates of natural selection acting at the genetic level and found over 3000 estimates of selection coefficients from 79 studies. Selection coefficients were roughly exponentially distributed, suggesting that the impact of selection at the genetic level is generally weak but can occasionally be quite strong. We used both nonparametric statistics and formal random-effects meta-analysis to determine how selection varies across biological and methodological categories. Selection was stronger when measured over shorter timescales, with the mean magnitude of s greatest for studies that measured selection within a single generation. Our analyses found conflicting trends when considering how selection varies with the genetic scale (e.g., SNPs or haplotypes) at which it is measured, suggesting a need for further research. Besides these quantitative conclusions, we highlight key issues in the calculation, interpretation, and reporting of selection coefficients and provide recommendations for future research.","2016-04","2018-06-13 08:29:37","2018-06-13 08:30:15","2018-06-13 08:29:37","1429-1448","","7","25","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 124","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IC4S3WAL\Thurman and Barrett - The genetic consequences of selection in natural p.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MLCI77M4\mec13559-sup-0001-suppinfo.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EVPNYCKU\mec13559-sup-0002-appendix.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JEGETBX9\mec13559-sup-0003-appendixs2.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KKG7A3PC\mec13559-sup-0004-appendix1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6ULRT7WY\mec13559-sup-0005-appendix2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S4GYZUTG\mec.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; natural selection; evolution; genetics; natural populations; selection coefficient","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Organismal morphology, body stoichiometry, and physiology can be readily linked to large-scale ecosystem processes through functional traits that inform on interspecific and species-environment interactions; yet such effect traits are still poorly included in trait-based approaches. Given their key trophic position in aquatic ecosystems, individual zooplankton affect energy fluxes and elemental processing. We compiled a large database of zooplankton traits contributing to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling and examined the effect of classification and habitat (marine vs. freshwater) on trait relationships. Respiration and nutrient excretion rates followed mass-dependent scaling in both habitats, with exponents ranging from 0.70 to 0.90. Our analyses revealed surprising differences in allometry and respiration between habitats, with freshwater species having lower length-specific mass and three times higher mass-specific respiration rates. These differences in traits point to implications for ecological strategies as well as overall carbon storage and fluxes based on habitat type. Our synthesis quantifies multiple trait relationships and links organisms to ecosystem processes they influence, enabling a more complete integration of aquatic community ecology and biogeochemistry through the promising use of effect traits.","2016-04","2018-06-13 08:46:58","2018-06-13 08:47:42","2018-06-13 08:46:58","1069-1080","","4","97","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 125","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V4MPGVFI\Hébert et al. - A meta-analysis of zooplankton functional traits i.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C59HDDBS\15-1084.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","body size; physiology; ecosystem functioning; effect traits; zooplankton","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most data were gathered from the literature, with the balance being provided by zooplankton ecologists. With the aim of more fully assessing zooplankton effects on elemental processes such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) stocks and fluxes in aquatic ecosystems, this data set provides information on the following traits: body size (length and mass), trophic group, elemental and biochemical corporal composition (N, P, C, lipid and protein content), respiration rates, N- and P-excretion rates, as well as stoichiometric ratios. Although relationships for zooplankton metabolism as a function of body mass or requirements have been explored in the past three decades, data have not been systematically compiled nor examined from an integrative and large-scale perspective across crustacean taxa and habitat types. While this contribution likely represents the most comprehensive such assembly of traits for both marine and freshwater species, this data set is not exhaustive either. As a result, this compilation also identifies knowledge gaps; a fact that should encourage researchers to disclose information they may have to help complete such databases. This trait matrix is made available for the first time in this data paper; prior to its release, the data set has been analyzed in a meta-analysis published as a companion paper (Hébert et al. in press). These data should prove extremely valuable for aquatic ecologists for trait-based characterization of plankton community structure as well as biogeochemical modeling. These data are also well-suited for deriving shortcut relationships that predict more difficult to measure trait values, most of which can be directly related to ecosystem properties (i.e., effect traits), from simpler traits (e.g., body size), and for exploring patterns of trait variation within and amongst taxonomic units or ecosystem types. Overall, this data set is likely to provide new insights into the functional structure of zooplankton communities and increase our mechanistic understanding of the influence of these pivotal organisms on aquatic ecosystems.

This decoupling of previously reliable environmental cues shifts adaptive landscapes, favors novel suites of traits and likely increases the extinction risk of local populations. Here, I examine the fitness consequences of changing climates. Meta-analyses demonstrate that simulated future climates depress viability and fecundity components of fitness for native plant species in the short term, which could reduce population growth rates. Contracting populations that cannot adapt or adjust plastically to new climates might not be capable of producing sufficient migrants to track changing conditions.","2016-04","2018-06-13 09:01:22","2018-06-13 09:02:34","2018-06-13 09:01:22","81-87","","1","210","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Author.

Sexual selection may arise before and/or after mating, or vary according to other factors such as the social environment. However, bouts of selection are typically considered in isolation. We measured the strength and pattern of selection acting on the length of the male intromittent organ (or processus) in two closely related species of lygaeid seed bug: Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans. In both species, we measured both pre- and post-copulatory selection. For L. equestris, we also varied the experimental choice design used in mating trials. We found contrasting pre- and post-copulatory selection on processus length in L. equestris. Furthermore, significant pre-copulatory selection was only seen in mating trials in which two males were present. This selection likely arises indirectly due to selection on a correlated trait, as the processus does not interact with the female prior to copulation. In contrast, we were unable to detect significant pre- or post-copulatory selection on processus length in L. simulans. However, a formal meta-analysis of previous estimates of post-copulatory selection on processus length in L. simulans suggests that there is significant stabilising selection across studies, but the strength of selection varies between experiments. Our results emphasise that the strength and direction of sexual selection on genital traits may be multifaceted and can vary across studies, social contexts and different stages of reproduction.Significance statementAnimal genitalia vary greatly in size and complexity across species, and selection acting on genital size and shape can be complex. In this study, we show that the length of the penis in two species of seed bug is subject to complex patterns of selection, varying depending on the social context and whether selection is measured before or after mating. In one of the species, we show unexpectedly that penis length is correlated with male mating success, despite the fact that the penis does not interact with the female prior to mating. Our results highlight the fact that genitalia may be subject to both direct and indirect selection at different stages of mating and that to fully understand the evolution of such traits we should combine estimates of selection arising from these multiple episodes.","2016-04-01","2018-06-13 09:07:59","2018-06-13 09:08:26","2018-06-13 09:07:59","625-637","","4","70","","Behav Ecol Sociobiol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 128","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BDCZMH8K\265_2016_2082_MOESM1_ESM.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ANMT59NM\Dougherty and Shuker - 2016 - Variation in pre- and post-copulatory sexual selec.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QGILV7V6\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, a primary question arises: which landscape size best predicts the effects of forest cover on restoration success? To answer this question, we conducted a global meta-analysis for biodiversity (mammals, birds, invertebrates, herpetofauna and plants) and measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, height, biomass and litter). Response ratios were calculated for comparisons between reference (e.g. old-growth forest) and disturbed sites (degraded or restored). Using an information-theoretic approach, mean response ratio (restoration success) and response ratio variance (restoration predictability) within each study landscape were regressed against the percentage of overall (summed forest cover) and contiguous (summed pixels of ≥60% forest cover) forest within eight different buffer sizes of radius 5–200 km (at 1-km resolution). We included 247 studies encompassing 196 study landscapes and 4360 quantitative comparisons. The best buffer (landscape) size varied for the following: (i) overall and contiguous forest cover, (ii) biodiversity and vegetation structure and (iii) mean response ratio and response ratio variance. Only plant biodiversity was influenced by overall forest cover (buffer size of 5, 10 and 200 km radii), while plants (10 and 200 km radii), mammals (5, 10 and 50–200 km radii), invertebrates (5 and 10 km radii), cover (5 km radii), height (5 km radii) and litter (100 km radii) were influenced by contiguous forest cover. Overall, mean response ratio and response ratio variance were positively and negatively nonlinearly related with both overall and contiguous forest cover, respectively.

Thus, a primary question arises: which landscape size best predicts the effects of forest cover on restoration success? To answer this question, we conducted a global meta-analysis for biodiversity (mammals, birds, invertebrates, herpetofauna and plants) and measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, height, biomass and litter). Response ratios were calculated for comparisons between reference (e.g. old-growth forest) and disturbed sites (degraded or restored). Using an information-theoretic approach, mean response ratio (restoration success) and response ratio variance (restoration predictability) within each study landscape were regressed against the percentage of overall (summed forest cover) and contiguous (summed pixels of ≥60% forest cover) forest within eight different buffer sizes of radius 5–200 km (at 1-km resolution). We included 247 studies encompassing 196 study landscapes and 4360 quantitative comparisons. The best buffer (landscape) size varied for the following: (i) overall and contiguous forest cover, (ii) biodiversity and vegetation structure and (iii) mean response ratio and response ratio variance. Only plant biodiversity was influenced by overall forest cover (buffer size of 5, 10 and 200 km radii), while plants (10 and 200 km radii), mammals (5, 10 and 50–200 km radii), invertebrates (5 and 10 km radii), cover (5 km radii), height (5 km radii) and litter (100 km radii) were influenced by contiguous forest cover. Overall, mean response ratio and response ratio variance were positively and negatively nonlinearly related with both overall and contiguous forest cover, respectively. We reveal for the first time a clear pattern of increasing restoration success and decreasing uncertainty as contiguous forest cover increases. We also indicate preliminary recommended buffer sizes for investigating landscape restoration effects on biodiversity and vegetation structure. However, the coarse grain and variability in the data mean the optimal landscape size may not have been detected; thus, further research is needed. Synthesis and applications.

Seagrasses are globally declining and their reintroduction has been shown to restore ecosystem functions. However, seagrass restoration is often challenging, given the dynamic and stressful environment that seagrasses often grow in. From our world-wide meta-analysis of seagrass restoration trials (1786 trials), we describe general features and best practice for seagrass restoration. We confirm that removal of threats is important prior to replanting. Reduced water quality (mainly eutrophication), and construction activities led to poorer restoration success than, for instance, dredging, local direct impact and natural causes. Proximity to and recovery of donor beds were positively correlated with trial performance. Planting techniques can influence restoration success. The meta-analysis shows that both trial survival and seagrass population growth rate in trials that survived are positively affected by the number of plants or seeds initially transplanted. This relationship between restoration scale and restoration success was not related to trial characteristics of the initial restoration. The majority of the seagrass restoration trials have been very small, which may explain the low overall trial survival rate (i.e. estimated 37%). Successful regrowth of the foundation seagrass species appears to require crossing a minimum threshold of reintroduced individuals. Our study provides the first global field evidence for the requirement of a critical mass for recovery, which may also hold for other foundation species showing strong positive feedback to a dynamic environment. Synthesis and applications. For effective restoration of seagrass foundation species in its typically dynamic, stressful environment, introduction of large numbers is seen to be beneficial and probably serves two purposes. First, a large-scale planting increases trial survival – large numbers ensure the spread of risks, which is needed to overcome high natural variability. Secondly, a large-scale trial increases population growth rate by enhancing self-sustaining feedback, which is generally found in foundation species in stressful environments such as seagrass beds. Thus, by careful site selection and applying appropriate techniques, spreading of risks and enhancing self-sustaining feedback in concert increase success of seagrass restoration.","2016-04","2018-06-13 09:29:01","2018-06-13 09:30:15","2018-06-13 09:29:01","567-578","","2","53","","","Global analysis of seagrass restoration","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors.

Within each ecosystem we examined if green (grazing) food webs are more sensitive to plant invasions compared to brown (detrital) food webs. Invasive plants have strong negative effects on primary consumers (detritivores, bacterivores, fungivores, and/or herbivores) in woodlands and wetlands, which become less abundant in both green and brown food webs in woodlands and green webs in wetlands. Plant invasions increased abundances of secondary consumers (predators and/or parasitoids) only in woodland brown food webs and green webs in wetlands.

The genetic structure of parasites is expected to conform to that of their hosts, because host dispersal is generally assumed to drive parasite dispersal. Here, we used a meta-analysis to test this paradigm and determine whether traits related to host dispersal correctly predict the spatial co-distribution of host and parasite genetic variation. We compiled data from empirical work on local adaptation and host–parasite population genetic structure from a wide range of taxonomic groups. We found that genetic differentiation was significantly lower in parasites than in hosts, suggesting that dispersal may often be higher for parasites. A significant correlation in the pairwise genetic differentiation of hosts and parasites was evident, but surprisingly weak. These results were largely explained by parasite reproductive mode, the proportion of free-living stages in the parasite life cycle and the geographical extent of the study; variables related to host dispersal were poor predictors of genetic patterns. Our results do not dispel the paradigm that parasite population genetic structure depends on host dispersal. Rather, we highlight that alternative factors are also important in driving the co-distribution of host and parasite genetic variation.","2016-03","2018-06-15 05:50:41","2018-06-15 05:51:19","2018-06-15 05:50:41","336-347","","3","19","","","Host dispersal as the driver of parasite genetic structure","","","","","","","en","© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 135","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\G7LNB4WX\ele12564-sup-0001-tables1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EUGLZK5Y\Mazé‐Guilmo et al. - Host dispersal as the driver of parasite genetic s.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6QSRP49J\ele.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","population genetics; meta-analyses; plants; gene flow; local adaptation; Animals; co-structure; coevolution; host–parasite interactions; migration rate; trait diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the following hypotheses: (H1) The direct effects of resource fluxes (bottom-up) should be stronger than the direct effects of consumer fluxes (top-down), because resource fluxes are permanent (do not return to the food web in which they were produced) but consumer fluxes may not be (consumers can leave). (H2) Following H1, the indirect effects should attenuate (weaken) more quickly for consumer fluxes than for resource fluxes due to their direct effects being weaker. (H3) The effects of resource fluxes should be stronger when recipient food webs are in different ecosystems than donor food webs due to differences in elevation that accompany cross-ecosystem food web interfaces, often increasing flux quantity due to gravity, while the effects of consumer fluxes should be stronger when donor and recipient food webs are in the same ecosystem as they should more easily assimilate into the recipient food web. We found no differences in the magnitude of bottom-up and top-down direct effects for resource and consumer fluxes, but top-down direct effects were 122% stronger than top-down indirect effects. Indirect effects of prey and predator fluxes quickly attenuated while indirect effects of non-prey resource and herbivore fluxes did not, as the overall direct effects of prey and predator fluxes were 123% and 163% stronger than their indirect effects, respectively. This result suggests that the magnitude of indirect effects decrease as the trophic level of resource and consumer fluxes increases, and also contrasts with results from studies showing in situ top-down indirect effects are stronger than in situ bottom-up indirect effects. We found that resource and consumer flux effect sizes were similar when they occurred between ecosystems, but when they occurred within ecosystems predator flux effects were 107% stronger than nutrient flux effects. Finally, we found that observational studies had higher effect sizes than manipulative studies. Future research should focus on how resource and consumer fluxes might interact and generate feedbacks in empirical studies of natural food webs, and what ecological factors might affect their relative strength.","2016-03","2018-06-15 05:56:27","2018-06-15 05:57:07","2018-06-15 05:56:27","594-604","","3","97","","","Synthesis","","","","","","","en","© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 136","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HWJABC9S\ecy1253-sup-0001-appendixs1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LZ9ULSQT\ecy1253-sup-0002-appendixs2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5HATIDYC\ecy1253-sup-0003-datas1.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UI5SE46J\ecy1253-sup-0004-metadatas1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\E6L6KTZQ\Allen and Wesner - Synthesis comparing effects of resource and consu.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K5EKFTGI\15-1109.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","trophic cascade; cross-ecosystem flux; cross-habitat foraging; edge effect; meta-ecosystem; metacommunity; resource subsidy; spatial subsidy; spillover predation; top-down vs. bottom-up control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested several hypotheses about the evolution of chemical defenses in plant-feeding insects using a meta-analysis. We analyzed the effectiveness (in terms of prey survival; 159 publications) and costs (in terms of reduction in performance due to defense production; 33 publications) of chemical defenses in various prey–predator systems (140 herbivore species and 124 enemy species). The chemical defenses of insect herbivores, on average, were effective against generalist predators, were not effective against specialist predators and generalist parasitoids, and increased the risk of parasitism by specialist parasitoids. The defenses were more effective against vertebrate than against invertebrate predators and most effective against birds. Defensive compounds synthesized de novo and derived from the herbivore's food plants did not differ in the magnitude of their effects. Externalization of chemical defenses enhanced their effects on naïve vertebrate predators but simultaneously increased the risk of parasitism. The defenses of specialist herbivores were more effective than those of generalists, mostly due to species that sequestered plant allelochemicals for their own defenses. Advertising of chemical defenses by warning display enhanced their effectiveness only against vertebrate predators. Aposematic colors and patterns were more effective warning signals than other types of conspicuous coloration against both experienced and naïve vertebrate predators, suggesting that certain colors and/or patterns were more important than conspicuousness for both learning and innate avoidance. The meta-analysis did not reveal physiological costs of the production of chemical defenses across 22 herbivore species, although the results varied strongly with the method used to measure these costs. We conclude that the cost–benefit trade-offs driving the evolution of chemical defenses in herbivorous insects are affected by ecological costs (i.e., increased susceptibility to parasitoids) more than by costs in terms of resources. Still, a favorable cost–benefit ratio, i.e., great effects for a small expenditure, may partly explain the prevalence of chemical anti-predator defenses in insects.","2016-02","2018-06-15 06:05:58","2018-06-15 06:06:36","2018-06-15 06:05:58","107-124","","1","86","","","The costs and effectiveness of chemical defenses in herbivorous insects","","","","","","","en","© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 137","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EGXRXGHG\ecm1206-sup-0001-supinfo.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GBBRYCKL\Zvereva and Kozlov - The costs and effectiveness of chemical defenses i.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VCXJ2K3D\15-0911.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; predators; birds; allelochemicals; aposematism; cost–benefit trade-offs; de novo synthesis; defense externalization; diet specialization; experimental methods; parasitoids; predator experience; prey survival; sequestration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, shifting from annual to perennial crops has been advocated towards a more sustainable agriculture. Nevertheless, wild perennial species have lower seed production than selected annuals, raising the questions of whether there is a fundamental trade-off between reproductive effort and life span, and whether such trade-off can be overcome through selection. In order to address these questions and to isolate life span from phylogenetic and environmental factors, we conducted a meta-analysis encompassing c. 3000 congeneric annual/perennial pairs from 28 genera. This meta-analysis is complemented with a minimalist model of long-term productivity in perennial species. Perennials allocate more resources belowground and less to seeds than congeneric annuals, independently of selection history. However, existing perennial wheat and rice could achieve yields similar to annuals if they survived three years and each year doubled their biomass, as other perennial grasses do. Selected perennial crops maintain the large belowground allocation of wild perennials, and thus can provide desired regulatory ecosystem services. To match the seed yield of annuals, biomass production of perennial grains must be increased to amounts attained by some perennial grasses – if this goal can be met, perennial crops can provide a more sustainable alternative to annuals.","2016-01","2018-06-15 07:46:38","2018-06-15 07:49:10","2018-06-15 07:46:38","104-114","","1","209","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 148","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JVPYW2U6\Vico et al. - Trade-offs between seed output and life span – a q.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W9EE6PRR\nph13574-sup-0001-supinfo.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LEQ2NP38\nph13574-sup-0002-tables2.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SSHJFYWK\nph13574-sup-0003-tables3.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NXJBWPJ4\nph13574-sup-0004-tables4.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KSJA9ME4\nph.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","agricultural sustainability; annual species; biomass allocation; ecophysiological trade-offs; perennial species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This relationship should be strongest when observed at medium extents and resolutions with respect to parasitoids’ foraging range, and turn negative at fine resolutions. The relationship is also hypothesized to depend on certain traits of the host and parasitoid taxa – for example being more positive for more specialized hosts or parasitoids and more negative for mobile hosts or gregarious parasitoids. Building on earlier literature reviews, it is now possible to investigate these hypotheses using meta-analysis. We performed a multi-factor meta-analysis on 151 analyses of parasitism rates with respect to host densities at specified scales, from 61 empirical studies published from 1988 to 2012. We explored how the correlation between host density and parasitism rate may be related to the explanatory variables already mentioned, plus parasitoid body length and various other characteristics of both hosts and parasitoids. Correlations (Pearson's r) between host density and parasitism rate ranged from –0·88 to 0·98 (mean 0·16, standard deviation 0·39). The correlation was more often negative where the host was exotic or in the orders Lepidoptera or Diptera, where the parasitoid was larger or exotic, or where the study was conducted at a finer grain size. Hymenoptera and Homoptera were the most likely host orders to reveal positive associations, with Coleoptera and Diptera intermediate. The fact that increased observational grain size had similar effects to decreased parasitoid body length could be taken as evidence that parasitoids’ foraging ranges increase with their body length. However, the hypothesis about scale-specific foraging was not supported by studies that compared multiple scales. We conclude that parasitism most commonly produces positive (compensatory) spatial density dependence, but ecological context is all-important. These findings should help improve the design and interpretation of field experiments on parasitism as well as their application to the modelling of population dynamics and the practice of biological control.","2016-09","2018-06-15 07:59:09","2018-06-15 07:59:58","2018-06-15 07:59:09","1501-1510","","9","30","","","Scale-specific spatial density dependence in parasitoids","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors.

These relationships structure communities, promote biodiversity and help maintain food security. Nutrient loading may destabilise these mutualisms by altering the costs and benefits each partner incurs from interacting. Using meta-analyses, we show a near ubiquitous decoupling in mutualism performance across terrestrial and marine environments in which phototrophs benefit from enrichment at the expense of their heterotrophic partners. Importantly, heterotroph identity, their dependence on phototroph-derived C and the type of nutrient enrichment (e.g. nitrogen vs. phosphorus) mediated the responses of different mutualisms to enrichment. Nutrient-driven changes in mutualism performance may alter community organisation and ecosystem processes and increase costs of food production. Consequently, the decoupling of nutrient exchange mutualisms via alterations of the world's nitrogen and phosphorus cycles may represent an emerging threat of global change.","2016-01","2018-06-15 08:07:05","2018-06-15 08:09:22","2018-06-15 08:07:05","20-28","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 152","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IBV6HNYS\ele12538-sup-0001-figures1-s4.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\44D78MU9\ele12538-sup-0002-tables1.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5L38U5F5\ele12538-sup-0003-tables2.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C83Z6DVL\ele12538-sup-0004-tables3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I9IE5KS9\Shantz et al. - Nutrient loading alters the performance of key nut.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\U8M9LCA5\ele.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","eutrophication; parasitism; Coral; mutualism; mycorrhizae; nutrient loading; nutrification; rhizobia; Symbiodinium; symbiosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, rmax can be a difficult parameter to estimate, particularly for long-lived species, for which appropriate life table data or abundance time series are typically not obtainable. We describe a method for improving estimates of rmax for long-lived species by integrating life-history theory (allometric models) and population-specific demographic data (life table models). Broad allometric relationships, such as those between life history traits and body size, have long been recognized by ecologists. These relationships are useful for deriving theoretical expectations for rmax, but rmax for real populations may vary from simple allometric estimators for “archetypical” species of a given taxa or body mass. Meanwhile, life table approaches can provide population-specific estimates of rmax from empirical data, but these may have poor precision from imprecise and missing vital rate parameter estimates. Our method borrows strength from both approaches to provide estimates that are consistent with both life-history theory and population-specific empirical data, and are likely to be more robust than estimates provided by either method alone. Our method uses an allometric constant: the product of rmax and the associated generation time for a stable-age population growing at this rate. We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the mean and variance of this allometric constant across well-studied populations from three vertebrate taxa (birds, mammals, and elasmobranchs) and found that the mean was approximately 1.0 for each taxon. We used these as informative Bayesian priors that determine how much to “shrink” imprecise vital rate estimates for a data-limited population toward the allometric expectation. The approach ultimately provides estimates of rmax (and other vital rates) that reflect a balance of information from the individual studied population, theoretical expectation, and meta-analysis of other populations. We applied the method specifically to an archetypical petrel (representing the genus Procellaria) and to white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in the context of estimating sustainable fishery bycatch limits.","2016-01","2018-06-15 08:21:47","2018-06-15 08:23:30","2018-06-15 08:21:47","322-333","","1","26","","","Improved estimation of intrinsic growth rmax for long-lived species","","","","","","","en","© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 153","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KBGUKZ3H\eap1209-sup-0001-appendixs1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3CBJYD2A\eap1209-sup-0002-supplement1.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BCARJ7X2\eap1209-sup-0003-supplement2.zip; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\67C65QFQ\Dillingham et al. - Improved estimation of intrinsic growth rmax for l.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UCQ3XD9E\14-1990.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","demography; population dynamics; allometric (rT) models; Bayesian analysis; Carcharodon carcharias; integrated population models; intrinsic growth rate; life-table models; long-lived species; Procellaria; white shark","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The response ratio for plant N:P was negatively correlated with the response ratio for plant growth in croplands and grasslands, and showed a stronger relationship for P than for N.

One way to understand the evolution of such a group-level phenomenon is to compare horizontally patterns of correlations among populations (or species) or follow longitudinally the same population over years in the light of parallel differences in the environment. We applied the longitudinal approach to 8-year field data and analyzed phenotypic correlations, and their within- and between-individual components, among three behaviors (novelty avoidance, aggression, and risk-taking) in male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, in a meta-analytic framework. The phenotypic correlation between novelty avoidance and aggression varied heterogeneously (it was positive in some years, while it was negative in other years), while the other pair-wise correlations were consistently positive over the study period. We investigated four potential socio-ecological factors, and found evidence that the among-year alterations in the demographic structure of the population (density, age composition) can be responsible for the heterogeneous effect sizes. Comparing within- and between-individual correlations across pairs of traits, we found that the correlation between aggression and risk-taking at the among-individual level was the strongest suggesting that this relationship has the highest potential to form a behavioral syndrome. Within-year repeatabilities varied among traits, but were systematically higher than between-year repeatabilities. Our study highlights on an empirical basis that there can be several biological and statistical reasons behind detecting a phenotypic correlation in a study, but only few of these imply that fixed behavioral syndromes are maintained in a natural population. In fact, some correlations seem to be shaped by environmental fluctuations.","2015-12-01","2018-06-15 09:13:09","2018-06-15 09:13:48","2018-06-15 09:13:09","2005-2017","","12","69","","Behav Ecol Sociobiol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 159","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XU5XTYFK\Garamszegi et al. - 2015 - Among-year variation in the repeatability, within-.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CMDFN6RT\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas predator potentially control standing biomass and species interactions in food webs, their effects on prey biomass and especially prey biodiversity have not yet been systematically quantified. Here, we test the effects of predation in a cross-system meta-analysis of prey diversity and biomass responses to local manipulation of predator presence. We found 291 predator removal experiments from 87 studies assessing both diversity and biomass responses. Across ecosystem types, predator presence significantly decreased both biomass and diversity of prey across ecosystems. Predation effects were highly similar between ecosystem types, whereas previous studies had shown that herbivory or decomposition effects differed fundamentally between terrestrial and aquatic systems based on different stoichiometry of plant material. Such stoichiometric differences between systems are unlikely for carnivorous predators, where effect sizes on species richness strongly correlated to effect sizes on biomass. However, the negative predation effect on prey biomass was ameliorated significantly with increasing prey richness and increasing species richness of the manipulated predator assemblage. Moreover, with increasing richness of the predator assemblage present, the overall negative effects of predation on prey richness switched to positive effects. Our meta-analysis revealed strong general relationships between predator diversity, prey diversity and the interaction strength between trophic levels in terms of biomass. This study indicates that anthropogenic changes in predator abundance and diversity will potentially have strong effects on trophic interactions across ecosystems. Synthesis The past centuries we have experienced a dramatic loss of top–predator abundance and diversity in most types of ecosystems. To understand the direct consequences of predator loss on a global scale, we quantitatively summarized experiments testing predation effects on prey communities in a cross-system meta-analysis. Across ecosystem types, predator presence significantly decreased both biomass and diversity of prey, and predation effects were highly similar. However, with increasing predator richness, the overall negative effects of predation on prey richness switched to positive ones. Anthropogenic changes in predator communities will potentially have strong effects on prey diversity, biomass, and trophic interactions across ecosystems.","2015-11","2018-07-23 23:34:17","2018-07-23 23:35:43","2018-07-23 23:34:17","1427-1435","","11","124","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 163","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SZU88K4L\Katano et al. - A cross-system meta-analysis reveals coupled preda.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K7VH9V84\oik-02430.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3VNSKL6P\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the strength of size-assortative mating is known to vary considerably between species and the underlying mechanisms promoting this inter-specific variation remain largely unexplored. Size-assortative mating has been proposed to be particularly strong in simultaneous hermaphrodites, i.e. organisms that produce male and female gametes at the same time. Here, we build on this hypothesis by arguing that size-assortative mating mediated by sexual selection is generally stronger in reciprocally mating hermaphrodites compared with unilaterally mating species and separate-sexed organisms. We report a series of empirical tests suggesting that size-assortative mating in the unilaterally copulating freshwater snail Physa acuta is caused by spatial clustering of similar-sized individuals and not by mate choice. In addition, we present a meta-analysis testing, for the first time, the hypothesis that sexual selection-mediated size-assortative mating is stronger in reciprocally copulating simultaneous hermaphrodites. Overall, we found significant size-assortative mating across 18 tested species and substantial inter-specific variation. Importantly, part of this variation can be explained by mating type, providing support for the hypothesis that size-assortative mating is stronger in reciprocally mating hermaphrodites compared with unilaterally mating species. We highlight potential pitfalls when testing for sexual selection-mediated size-assortative mating and discuss the need for more experimental and comparative approaches in order to resolve the observed variation in the strength of size-assortative mating among species.","2015-11-01","2018-07-24 00:45:38","2018-07-24 00:46:08","2018-07-24 00:45:38","1867-1878","","11","69","","Behav Ecol Sociobiol","Size-assortative mating in simultaneous hermaphrodites","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 164","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ALFTGZYZ\265_2015_1999_MOESM1_ESM.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DG3TLUD2\Graham et al. - 2015 - Size-assortative mating in simultaneous hermaphrod.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VXBCVMB5\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One effect of stress hormone secretion is the alteration of circulating leucocytes, specifically an increase in the heterophil : lymphocyte ratio (HLR). There have been numerous studies and reviews of the relationship between the stress response and HLR, yet the data have not been systematically analysed across studies. Here, we performed meta-analyses of studies in which paired values of plasma corticosterone (CORT) and HLR were available to investigate the relationship between these parameters. Specifically, we analysed CORT and HLR as baseline measures between treatment (or ‘stressed’ populations) and control (or ‘reference’ populations). Additionally, we investigated the relationship within CORT and HLR to identify temporal patterns of the response as a result of the duration of the stressor. Across studies, we identified that CORT and HLR are significantly elevated in populations subjected to environmentally stressful conditions. While not significantly different, CORT tended to be more elevated than HLR in the stressed populations. We found that there is a significant, negative relationship between CORT and the temporal duration of environmental stress. Additionally, we found a significant break point in this response at 85 days of stress duration, above which there is not a clear relationship between CORT and duration. This indicates that the CORT response to environmental stress attenuates. We found a small but positive significant relationship between HLR and temporal duration of environmental stress. This suggests that the elevation of HLR in response to environmental stress does not decrease over time. Our data identified that data gaps of wild populations of species exist and that more studies pairing physiological stress responses will further our understanding of how populations respond to environmental challenges. We found that CORT and HLR responded differently to stress, depending on captivity status, whether the study population was the domestic chicken, and the sex of the study population.","2015-09","2018-07-24 00:52:12","2018-07-24 00:54:06","2018-07-24 00:52:12","1189-1196","","9","29","","","A meta-analysis of plasma corticosterone and heterophil","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors.

Although engineering impacts on the biota can vary from negative to positive, and from trivial to enormous, patterns and causes of variation in the magnitude of engineering effects across ecosystems and engineer types remain largely unknown. To elucidate the above patterns, we conducted a meta-analysis of 122 studies which explored effects of animal ecosystem engineers on species richness of other organisms in the community. The analysis revealed that the overall effect of ecosystem engineers on diversity is positive and corresponds to a 25% increase in species richness, indicating that ecosystem engineering is a facilitative process globally. Engineering effects were stronger in the tropics than at higher latitudes, likely because new or modified habitats provided by engineers in the tropics may help minimize competition and predation pressures on resident species. Within aquatic environments, engineering impacts were stronger in marine ecosystems (rocky shores) than in streams. In terrestrial ecosystems, engineers displayed stronger positive effects in arid environments (e.g. deserts). Ecosystem engineers that create new habitats or microhabitats had stronger effects than those that modify habitats or cause bioturbation. Invertebrate engineers and those with lower engineering persistence (<1 year) affected species richness more than vertebrate engineers which persisted for >1 year. Invertebrate species richness was particularly responsive to engineering impacts. This study is the first attempt to build an integrative framework of engineering effects on species diversity; it highlights the importance of considering latitude, habitat, engineering functional group, taxon and persistence of their effects in future theoretical and empirical studies.","2015-08","2018-07-24 00:58:01","2018-07-24 00:58:56","2018-07-24 00:58:01","877-890","","3","90","","","Ecosystem engineering effects on species diversity across ecosystems","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

Here, we conducted the first meta-analysis of δ15N AA values from measurements of 359 marine species covering four trophic levels, and compared TP estimates from AA-CSIA to literature values derived from food items, gut or stomach content analysis. We tested whether the AA trophic enrichment factor (TEF), or the 15N enrichment among different individual AAs is constant across trophic levels and whether inclusion of δ15N values from multiple AAs improves TP estimation. For the TEF of glutamic acid relative to phenylalanine (Phe) we found an average value of 6.6 ‰ across all taxa, which is significantly lower than the commonly applied 7.6 ‰. We found that organism feeding ecology influences TEF values of several trophic AAs relative to Phe, with significantly higher TEF values for herbivores compared to omnivores and carnivores, while TEF values were also significantly lower for animals excreting urea compared to ammonium. Based on the comparison of multiple model structures using the metadata of δ15N AA values we show that increasing the number of AAs in principle improves precision in TP estimation. This meta-analysis clarifies the advantages and limitations of using individual δ15N AA values as tools in trophic ecology and provides a guideline for the future application of AA-CSIA to food web studies.","2015-07-01","2018-07-24 01:06:10","2018-07-24 01:06:35","2018-07-24 01:06:10","631-642","","3","178","","Oecologia","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 170","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7N8DDIC8\442_2015_3305_MOESM1_ESM.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W74QKP7F\Nielsen et al. - 2015 - Meta-analysis of amino acid stable nitrogen isotop.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K2JFKFZR\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Omnivores, such as crayfish, are among the most important groups of invaders. Their introduction often results in biodiversity loss, particularly of their native counterparts. Managed relocations of native crayfish from areas under threat from invasive crayfish into isolated ‘ark sites’ are sometimes suggested as a conservation strategy for native crayfish; however, such relocations may have unintended detrimental consequences for the recipient ecosystem. Despite this, there have been few attempts to quantify the relative impacts of native and invasive crayfish on aquatic ecosystems. To address this deficiency we conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of native and invasive crayfish on nine ecosystem components: decomposition rate, primary productivity, plant biomass, invertebrate density, biomass and diversity, fish biomass and refuge use, and amphibian larval survival. Native and invasive crayfish significantly reduced invertebrate density and biomass, fish biomass and amphibian survival rate and significantly increased decomposition rates. Invasive crayfish also significantly reduced plant biomass and invertebrate diversity and increased primary productivity. These results show that native and invasive crayfish have wide-ranging impacts on aquatic ecosystems that may be exacerbated for invasive species. Subsequent analysis showed that the impacts of invasive crayfish were significantly greater, in comparison to native crayfish, for decomposition and primary productivity but not invertebrate density, biomass and diversity. Overall, our findings reconfirm the ecosystem altering abilities of both native and invasive crayfish, enforcing the need to carefully regulate managed relocations of native species as well as to develop control programs for invasives.","2015-05-01","2018-07-24 01:14:36","2018-07-24 01:15:16","2018-07-24 01:14:36","309-316","","1","178","","Oecologia","Comparing the ecological impacts of native and invasive crayfish","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 171","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GPFZ9GEC\442_2014_3195_MOESM1_ESM.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JQARG8VZ\442_2014_3195_MOESM2_ESM.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CKYLUPZX\442_2014_3195_MOESM3_ESM.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YYN4PUPD\442_2014_3195_MOESM4_ESM.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6BCS2JKA\James et al. - 2015 - Comparing the ecological impacts of native and inv.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\R362NCQ4\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results revealed that lutein and xanthophyll cycle pigments (VAZ) were highly responsive to the environment, emphasizing the high phenotypic plasticity of VAZ, whereas neoxanthin was very stable. The present meta-analysis supports the existence of relatively narrow limits for pigment ratios and also supports the presence of a pool of free ‘unbound’ VAZ. Results from this study provide highly reliable ranges of photosynthetic pigment contents as a framework for future research on plant pigments.","2015-04","2018-07-24 01:23:57","2018-07-24 01:25:03","2018-07-24 01:23:57","268-280","","1","206","","","Internal and external factors affecting photosynthetic pigment composition in plants","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

Resulting shifts in wildlife ecology can alter infectious disease dynamics and create opportunities for cross-species transmission, yet predicting host–pathogen responses to resource provisioning is challenging. Factors enhancing transmission, such as increased aggregation, could be offset by better host immunity due to improved nutrition. Here, we conduct a review and meta-analysis to show that food provisioning results in highly heterogeneous infection outcomes that depend on pathogen type and anthropogenic food source. We also find empirical support for behavioural and immune mechanisms through which human-provided resources alter host exposure and tolerance to pathogens. A review of recent theoretical models of resource provisioning and infection dynamics shows that changes in host contact rates and immunity produce strong non-linear responses in pathogen invasion and prevalence. By integrating results of our meta-analysis back into a theoretical framework, we find provisioning amplifies pathogen invasion under increased host aggregation and tolerance, but reduces transmission if provisioned food decreases dietary exposure to parasites. These results carry implications for wildlife disease management and highlight areas for future work, such as how resource shifts might affect virulence evolution.","2015-05","2018-07-24 01:31:45","2018-07-24 01:32:42","2018-07-24 01:31:45","483-495","","5","18","","","Linking anthropogenic resources to wildlife–pathogen dynamics","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors.

Wave-induced water velocities impose great drag forces, leading to a morphological tradeoff between light interception and drag reduction/tolerance. What are the hydrodynamic consequences of morphological diversification, such as increased branching? Drag was measured on artificial macroalgae of constant ‘photosynthetic’ area, but differing branching patterns, in a high-speed flume at water velocities up to 3.5 m s−1. A meta-analysis was used to compare dislodgement forces of branched and unbranched species of comparable sizes in the field to determine if drag-prone morphologies had greater attachment strengths. Branched fronds experienced greater drag than unbranched fronds of the same size. Greater drag in branched forms was not the result of increased projected area but probably resulted from greater pressure or friction drag. In the field, branched species resisted greater dislodgement forces than unbranched species of comparable size, suggesting that branched species compensate for increased drag with stronger attachment to the substratum. Branching has clear biomechanical consequences, increasing drag and the need for increased attachment. This raises questions about physiological and ecological advantages that may have driven the repeated evolution of biomechanically costly, branched morphologies.","2015-04","2018-07-24 01:40:31","2018-07-24 01:41:21","2018-07-24 01:40:31","133-140","","1","206","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors New Phytologist © 2014 New Phytologist Trust","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 179","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BCNHYA64\Starko et al. - Biomechanical consequences of branching in flexibl.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QPQP4TUX\nph13182-sup-0001-figss1-s3_tables1.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S4PQNZA7\nph.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","evolution; biomechanics; dislodgement; drag; hydrodynamics; intertidal; macroalgae morphology; reconfiguration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a meta-analysis of American lobster (Homarus americanus) abundance data throughout the entirety of the species’ range, testing competing hypotheses about bottom-up (climate, temperature) vs. top-down (predation, fishing) regulation along a strong thermal gradient. Our results suggest an interaction between predation and thermal range – predation effects dominated at the cold and warm extremes, but not at the centre of the species’ range. Similarly, there was consistent support for a positive climate effect on lobster recruitment at warm range extremes. In contrast, fishing effort followed, rather than led changes in lobster abundance over time.

Increasingly, studies classify the urban landscape in more detail, quantifying separately the effects of individual urban features on biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors influencing biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently been analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing biodiversity levels within cities is still lacking. We here present the first meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity variation across a large variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities worldwide. Our results show that patch area and corridors have the strongest positive effects on biodiversity, complemented by vegetation structure. Local, biotic and management habitat variables were significantly more important than landscape, abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50 ha are necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species.

A large number of case studies show that organisms can affect erosion, but a comprehensive understanding of biological impacts on sediment transport conditions is still lacking. We use meta-analysis to synthesize published data to quantify the effects of the abundance, body size, and behavior of organisms on erosion in streams. We also explore the influence of current velocity, discharge, and sediment grain size on the strength of biotic effects on erosion. We found that species that both increase erosion (destabilizers) and decrease erosion (stabilizers) can alter incipient sediment motion, sediment suspension, and sediment deposition above control conditions in which the organisms were not present. When abundance was directly manipulated, these biotic effects were consistently stronger in the higher abundance treatment, increasing effect sizes by 66%. Per capita effect size and per capita biomass were also consistently positively correlated. Fish and crustaceans were the most studied organisms, but aquatic insects increased the effect size by 550× compared to other types of organisms after accounting for biomass. In streams with lower discharge and smaller grain sizes, we consistently found stronger biotic effects. Taken collectively, these findings provide synthetic evidence that biology can affect physical processes in streams, and these effects can be mediated by hydraulic energy. We suggest that future studies focus on understudied organisms, such as biofilms, conducting experiments under realistic field conditions, and developing hypotheses for the effect of biology on erosion and velocity currents in the context of restoration to better understand the forces that mediate physical disturbances in stream ecosystems.","2015-05","2018-07-24 03:49:08","2018-07-24 03:50:21","2018-07-24 03:49:08","1329-1339","","5","96","","","Meta-analysis","","","","","","","en","© 2015 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 189","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VCR8T2IA\Albertson and Allen - Meta-analysis abundance, behavior, and hydraulic .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VMNF77DU\13-2138.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","meta-analysis; biophysical interactions; ecogeomorphology; ecohydrology; erosion; sediment transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Without gene flow from another population within the species (genetic rescue), these populations are likely to be extirpated. However, there have been only 20 published cases of such outcrossing for conservation purposes, probably a very low proportion of populations that would potentially benefit. As one impediment to genetic rescues is the lack of an overview of the magnitude and consistency of genetic rescue effects in wild species, I carried out a meta-analysis. Outcrossing of inbred populations resulted in beneficial effects in 92.9% of 156 cases screened as having a low risk of outbreeding depression. The median increase in composite fitness (combined fecundity and survival) following outcrossing was 148% in stressful environments and 45% in benign ones. Fitness benefits also increased significantly with maternal ΔF (reduction in inbreeding coefficient due to gene flow) and for naturally outbreeding versus inbreeding species. However, benefits did not differ significantly among invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. Evolutionary potential for fitness characters in inbred populations also benefited from gene flow. There are no scientific impediments to the widespread use of outcrossing to genetically rescue inbred populations of naturally outbreeding species, provided potential crosses have a low risk of outbreeding depression. I provide revised guidelines for the management of genetic rescue attempts.","2015-06","2018-07-24 05:26:20","2018-07-24 05:27:06","2018-07-24 05:26:20","2610-2618","","11","24","","","Genetic rescue of small inbred populations","","","","","","","en","© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 190","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WDU7PTKW\Frankham - Genetic rescue of small inbred populations meta-a.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FVB9SMLW\mec13139-sup-0001-tables1.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V5325V89\mec13139-sup-0002-supinfo.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SK6LWHTF\mec.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","outbreeding depression; evolutionary potential; genetic rescue guidelines; heterosis; inbreeding depression; outcrossing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate warming may cause substantial increases of leaf respiratory carbon fluxes, which would further impact the carbon balance of terrestrial vegetation. However, downregulation of respiratory physiology via thermal acclimation may mitigate this impact. We have conducted a meta-analysis with data collected from 43 independent studies to assess quantitatively the thermal acclimation capacity of leaf dark respiration to warming of terrestrial plant species from across the globe. In total, 282 temperature contrasts were included in the meta-analysis, representing 103 species of forbs, graminoids, shrubs, trees and lianas native to arctic, boreal, temperate and tropical ecosystems. Acclimation to warming was found to decrease respiration at a set temperature in the majority of the observations, regardless of the biome of origin and growth form, but respiration was not completely homeostatic across temperatures in the majority of cases. Leaves that developed at a new temperature had a greater capacity for acclimation than those transferred to a new temperature. We conclude that leaf respiration of most terrestrial plants can acclimate to gradual warming, potentially reducing the magnitude of the positive feedback between climate and the carbon cycle in a warming world. More empirical data are, however, needed to improve our understanding of interspecific variation in thermal acclimation capacity, and to better predict patterns in respiratory carbon fluxes both within and across biomes in the face of ongoing global warming.","2015-03-01","2018-07-24 05:32:04","2018-07-24 05:40:26","2018-07-24 05:32:04","885-900","","3","177","","Oecologia","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 192","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A52KSB5W\442_2014_3159_MOESM1_ESM.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\37W2YYLH\Slot and Kitajima - 2015 - General patterns of acclimation of leaf respiratio.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RRSXBPWI\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using random forest models, we identified from simulations a set of highly informative summary statistics allowing discriminating among the processes causing DIGD. Finally, combining these discriminant statistics and approximate Bayesian computations on a set of twelve empirical case studies, we hypothesized that DIGD were most likely due to the interaction of two of these three processes and that contrary to expectation, they were not solely caused by downstream-biased dispersal.","2015-08-18","2018-07-24 06:53:31","2018-07-24 06:53:31","2018-07-24 06:53:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S997EHJR\data_meta_analyse_global.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AKCRVDUQ\meta_analysis_fish.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J3LZFZ57\meta_analysis_fst.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Z4J8Y6LK\script_Meta_Analysis_global.R","","","Fish; Landscape Genetics; Population Genetics - Empirical; Population Genetics - Theoretical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because nutrient inputs differently impact high- and low-fertility systems, building a predictive framework for the impacts of anthropogenic and natural changes on ecological stoichiometry requires examining the flexibility in stoichiometric responses across a range of basal nutrient richness. Whether organisms or communities respond to changing conditions with stoichiometric homeostasis or flexibility is strongly regulated by their species-specific capacity for nutrient storage, relative growth rate, physiological plasticity, and the degree of environmental resource availability relative to organismal demand. Using a meta-analysis approach, we tested whether stoichiometric flexibility following nutrient enrichment correlates with the relative fertility of terrestrial and aquatic systems or with the initial stoichiometries of the organism or community. We found that regardless of limitation status, N-fertilization tended to significantly reduce biota C:N and increase N:P, and P fertilization reduced C:P and N:P in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. Further, stoichiometric flexibility in response to fertilization tended to decrease as environmental nutrient richness increased in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. Positive correlations were also detected between the initial biota C:nutrient ratio and stoichiometric flexibility in response to fertilization. Elucidating these relationships between stoichiometric flexibility, basal environmental and biota fertility, and fertilization will increase our understanding of the ecological consequences of ongoing nutrient enrichment across the world.","2015-07","2018-07-24 06:55:52","2018-07-24 06:57:03","2018-07-24 06:55:52","949-959","","7","124","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 199","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6FIV4SYA\Sistla et al. - Stoichiometric flexibility in response to fertiliz.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\L5KF62P2\oik-02385.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IISRGVHU\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on how non-native plant species are affected by disturbances. We explored whether the observed impact of disturbance on non-native plant communities is related to its type and frequency, to habitat type, study approach (observational or experimental), and to the temporal and spatial scales of the study. To put the results in a broader context, we also conducted a set of parallel analyses on a data set involving native plant species. The diversity and abundance of non-native plant species were significantly higher at disturbed sites than at undisturbed sites, while the diversity and abundance of native plant species did not differ between the two types of sites. The effect of disturbance on non-native plant species depended on the measure used to evaluate the impact (species diversity or abundance) and on disturbance type, with grazing and anthropogenic disturbances leading to higher diversity and abundance of non-native plant species than other disturbance types examined. The impact of disturbance on non-natives was also associated with study approach, habitat type and temporal scale, but these factors covaried with disturbance type, complicating the interpretation of the results. Overall, our results indicate that disturbance has a positive impact particularly on non-native plant species (at least when they are already present in the community), and that the strength of this impact depends primarily on the disturbance type. Synthesis Empirical evidence of the effect of disturbances on plant species richness is contradictory. Here we use a meta-analysis to synthesize the published literature on how different types of disturbances influence the diversity and abundance of plant species, focusing in particular on non-native plants. Our study supports the hypothesis that disturbances generally facilitate the diversity and abundance of non-native plant species, although the strength of this facilitation depends primarily on the disturbance type.","2015-02","2018-07-24 07:04:12","2018-07-24 07:04:57","2018-07-24 07:04:12","122-129","","2","124","","","Non-native plant species benefit from disturbance","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 200","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QC6FKWWH\Jauni et al. - Non-native plant species benefit from disturbance.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8VHI9CBJ\oik-01416.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3BTPGYUL\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a meta-analysis using 67 publications, involving 70 native and 55 invasive plant species to assess support for the enhanced mutualism hypothesis, the degraded mutualism hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis that factors other than invasive status (such as plant functional group) better predict AM function following invasion. We used multiple measurements to test these hypotheses: AM fungal colonization, growth responses to AM fungi and AM fungal-mediated shifts in competitive interactions among native and invasive plants. Additionally, we assessed whether invasive plants alter AM associations in native plants and whether native and invasive plants host different AM fungal abundances and communities. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization (%) and average growth responses did not differ between native and invasive plants. However, growth responses (±) were dampened among invasive plants, and the positive correlation between AM fungal colonization and growth response in native plants was absent in invasive plants. Rather than plant invasive status, plant functional group was a significant explanatory factor; forbs were generally more colonized and exhibited positive growth responses (when grown alone and in competition), whereas grass responses were neutral to negative. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance (measured by percentage colonization, extraradical hyphal and spore densities, as well as neutral lipid fatty acid and glomalin concentrations) did not differ between native and invasive plants, but invasive plants hosted different AM fungal communities in 78% of studies. AM fungal colonization of native plants was lower when grown with, or after, invasive plants, likely due to the prevalence of non-mycorrhizal plants in studies of neighbour and legacy effects. Synthesis. Neither the degraded nor the enhanced mutualism hypothesis was supported, suggesting that invasions do not select for directional shifts in AM associations. Instead, our results indicate that AM fungi are most likely to influence invasion trajectories when native and invasive plants belong to different functional groups.","2015-11","2018-07-24 07:34:12","2018-07-24 07:35:09","2018-07-24 07:34:12","1547-1556","","6","103","","","Do native and invasive plants differ in their interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi?","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors.

Here, we test the utility of phylogeny for predicting plant–soil feedbacks by undertaking a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis on all available pairwise plant–soil feedback experiments conducted over the last two decades, including 133 plant species in 329 pairwise interactions. We found that the sign and magnitude of plant–soil feedback effects were not explained by the phylogenetic distance separating interacting species.

Although it has been well documented that elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere greatly enhances biomass production in plants, the overall effect of elevated CO2 on reproductive allocation (RA), i.e., the proportion of biomass allocated to reproductive structures, is little understood. We combined meta-analysis with graphical vector analysis to examine the overall effect of elevated CO2 on RA and how other environmental factors, such as low nutrients, drought and elevated atmospheric ozone (O3), interacted with elevated CO2 in affecting RA in herbaceous plants. Averaged across all species of different functional groups and environmental conditions, elevated CO2 had little effect on RA (−0.9 %). RA in plants of different reproductive strategies and functional groups, however, differed in response to elevated CO2. For example, RA in iteroparous wild species decreased by 8 %, while RA in iteroparous crops increased significantly (+14 %) at elevated CO2. RA was unaffected by CO2 in plants grown with no stress or in low-nutrient soils. RA decreased at elevated CO2 and elevated O3, but increased in response to elevated CO2 in drought-stressed plants, suggesting that elevated CO2 could ameliorate the adverse effect of drought on crop production to some extent. Our results demonstrate that elevated CO2 and other global environmental changes have the potential to greatly alter plant community composition through differential effects on RA of different plant species and thus affect the dynamics of natural and agricultural ecosystems in the future.","2015-04-01","2018-07-24 07:50:48","2018-07-24 07:51:34","2018-07-24 07:50:48","1075-1087","","4","177","","Oecologia","Reproductive allocation in plants as affected by elevated carbon dioxide and other environmental changes","","","","","","","en","","","","","link-springer-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 203","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IZWMW2JJ\442_2014_3191_MOESM1_ESM.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Q5D5PAIP\Wang et al. - 2015 - Reproductive allocation in plants as affected by e.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2Q39PFDM\10.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We predicted that seed dispersal by ungulates acts as an ecological filter – which differentially affects individuals according to their characteristics and shapes species assemblages – and that the filter varies according to the dispersal mechanism (endozoochory, fur-epizoochory and hoof-epizoochory). We conducted two-step individual participant data meta-analyses of 52 studies on plant dispersal by ungulates in fragmented landscapes, comparing eight plant traits and two habitat indicators between dispersed and non-dispersed plants. We found that ungulates dispersed at least 44% of the available plant species. Moreover, some plant traits and habitat indicators increased the likelihood for plant of being dispersed. Persistent or nitrophilous plant species from open habitats or bearing dry or elongated diaspores were more likely to be dispersed by ungulates, whatever the dispersal mechanism. In addition, endozoochory was more likely for diaspores bearing elongated appendages whereas epizoochory was more likely for diaspores released relatively high in vegetation. Hoof-epizoochory was more likely for light diaspores without hooked appendages. Fur-epizoochory was more likely for diaspores with appendages, particularly elongated or hooked ones. We thus observed a gradient of filtering effect among the three dispersal mechanisms. Endozoochory had an effect of rather weak intensity (impacting six plant characteristics with variations between ungulate-dispersed and non-dispersed plant species mostly below 25%), whereas hoof-epizoochory had a stronger effect (eight characteristics included five ones with above 75% variation), and fur-epizoochory an even stronger one (nine characteristics included six ones with above 75% variation).

These studies involved 92 plant species and 70 species of insect herbivore (including simulated herbivory). Attack to plant stems reduced plant performance by an average of approximately 22%.

Measures of plant reproduction and vegetative biomass were reduced by 33% and 16% respectively, while measurements of photosynthetic rate were not significantly different between plants with and without stem herbivore attack. Stem herbivory led to a decline in leader performance but an increase in performance of laterals, highlighting the importance of plant compensation. Juvenile plants were more severely affected by stem herbivory than adult plants, and studies conducted in greenhouses found more severe effects than studies conducted in the field. Stem herbivory did not have a significant effects on any of the non-performance responses measured (defence compounds, SLA, root:shoot, phenology and plant carbon and nitrogen). We compare our results with results from various meta-analyses considering herbivory on other plant parts. The impact of insect herbivory to stems on plant performance appears at least as severe as insect herbivory to roots and leaves, if not more.","2015-03","2018-07-24 08:30:31","2018-07-24 08:31:12","2018-07-24 08:30:31","266-273","","3","124","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 208","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DSBNK9G2\Stephens and Westoby - Effects of insect attack to stems on plant surviva.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Z2BN3K5Z\oik-01809.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3S8TJ4ZI\other_responses.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EGXVQEDU\performance_responses.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZP88NVZL\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While inter-specific differences in hydraulic traits are widely documented, intra-specific hydraulic variability is less well known and is important for predicting climate change impacts. Here, I present a conceptual framework for this intra-specific hydraulic trait variability, reviewing the mechanisms that drive variability and the consequences for vegetation response to climate change. I performed a meta-analysis on published studies (n = 33) of intra-specific variation in a prominent hydraulic trait – water potential at which 50% stem conductivity is lost (P50) – and compared this variation to inter-specific variability within genera and plant functional types used by a dynamic global vegetation model. I found that intra-specific variability is of ecologically relevant magnitudes, equivalent to c. 33% of the inter-specific variability within a genus, and is larger in angiosperms than gymnosperms, although the limited number of studies highlights that more research is greatly needed. Furthermore, plant functional types were poorly situated to capture key differences in hydraulic traits across species, indicating a need to approach prediction of drought impacts from a trait-based, rather than functional type-based perspective.","2015-02","2018-07-24 08:38:28","2018-07-24 08:39:18","2018-07-24 08:38:28","1008-1014","","3","205","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

Forests where the understorey vegetation is recovering from past agricultural land use form an iconic example of such a system. The colonization capacity of forest plant species into post-agricultural forests has been related to dispersal traits in previous comparative analyses, demonstrating the significance of dispersal limitation. Yet, none of them has evaluated evidence for a phylogenetic signal in colonization capacity and, thus, explored the possibility that the dispersal traits are correlated with unmeasured establishment-related traits that are also shared through common ancestry. Here, we analysed the colonization capacity of 330 species into post-agricultural forests across seven different landscapes in Europe and North America. With phylogenetic meta-analysis models, we quantified the phylogenetic signal in colonization capacity and tested whether the colonization – dispersal trait relationships are confounded by phylogenetic non-independence. Closely related forest understorey species were more similar to one another in terms of their capacity to colonize post-agricultural forests than were more distantly related species. The correlations between dispersal traits and colonization were not independent from phylogeny. While we found some evidence of phylogenetic clustering of species' frequencies in post-agricultural communities, this was apparently not a result of strong filtering on dispersal traits. Synthesis. Given the phylogenetic signal in plant colonization capacity, a multitude of conserved species characteristics may explain community assembly in forests. Earlier trait-based syntheses strongly emphasised dispersal, but the factors limiting establishment and persistence of forest herbs in post-agricultural forests may be more nuanced than generally appreciated.","2015-01","2018-07-25 03:52:26","2018-07-25 03:53:20","2018-07-25 03:52:26","175-183","","1","103","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

They are compromised by transgene escape via the crop-maternal line. We therefore assess the efficacy of PBMs for transgenic rapeseed (Brassica napus) biocontainment across the United Kingdom by estimating crop-maternal hybridization with its two progenitor species. We used remote sensing, field surveys, agricultural statistics, and meta-analysis to determine the extent of sympatry between the crop and populations of riparian and weedy B. rapa and B. oleracea. We then estimated the incidence of crop-maternal hybridization across all settings to predict the efficacy of PBMs. Evidence of crop chloroplast capture by the progenitors was expanded to a national scale, revealing that crop-maternal gene flow occurs at widely variable rates and is dependent on both the recipient and setting. We use these data to explore the value that this kind of biocontainment can bring to genetic modification (GM) risk management in terms of reducing the impact that hybrids have on the environment rather than preventing or reducing hybrid abundance per se.","2015-02","2018-07-25 03:57:53","2021-03-11 08:59:26","2018-07-25 03:57:53","1342-1349","","3","205","","","Assessing the value of imperfect biocontainment nationally","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

Forest edges have been well studied in temperate and tropical forests, but less so in less productive, disturbance-adapted boreal forests. We synthesized data on forest vegetation at edges of boreal forests and compared edge influence among edge types (fire, cut, lake/wetland; old vs. young), forest types (broadleaf vs. coniferous) and geographic regions. Our objectives were to quantify vegetation responses at edges of all types and to compare the strength and extent of edge influence among different types of edges and forests. Research was conducted using the same general sampling design in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in Sweden and Finland. We conducted a meta-analysis for a variety of response variables including forest structure, deadwood abundance, regeneration, understorey abundance and diversity, and non-vascular plant cover. We also determined the magnitude and distance of edge influence (DEI) using randomization tests. Some edge responses (lower tree basal area, tree canopy and bryophyte cover; more logs; higher regeneration) were significant overall across studies. Edge influence on ground vegetation in boreal forests was generally weak, not very extensive (DEI usually < 20 m) and decreased with time. We found more extensive edge influence at natural edges, at younger edges and in broadleaf forests. The comparison among regions revealed weaker edge influence in Fennoscandian forests. Synthesis. Edges created by forest harvesting do not appear to have as strong, extensive or persistent influence on vegetation in boreal as in tropical or temperate forested ecosystems. We attribute this apparent resistance to shorter canopy heights, inherent heterogeneity in boreal forests and their adaptation to frequent natural disturbance. Nevertheless, notable differences between forest structure responses to natural (fire) and anthropogenic (cut) edges raise concerns about biodiversity implications of extensive creation of anthropogenic edges. By highlighting universal responses to edge influence in boreal forests that are significant irrespective of edge or forest type, and those which vary by edge type, we provide a context for the conservation of boreal forests.","2015-05","2018-07-25 04:10:11","2018-07-25 04:12:15","2018-07-25 04:10:11","550-562","","3","103","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Authors.

In socially monogamous species different genetic mating patterns appear when individuals mate outside the breeding pair within a breeding season (extra-pair mating) or when they change partners between two breeding seasons (widowing or divorce). Divorce can be defined as having occurred when two previously paired individuals are alive during the next breeding season and at least one of them has re-mated with a new partner. In socially monogamous birds divorce is widespread, but it is not clear whether it is a behavioural adaptation to improve the quality of a mating decision or whether, alternatively, it results as a non-selected consequence of other processes: existing studies suggest a heterogeneous set of results with respect to this central question. This heterogeneity could result from a number of factors, ranging from the methodological approaches used, to population- or species-specific characters. In this review we use phylogenetic meta-analyses to assess the evidence that divorce is adaptive (in terms of breeding success) across 64 species of socially monogamous birds. Second, we explore biological and methodological reasons for the heterogeneity in the results of previous studies. Results of our analyses supported the hypothesis that divorce is, in general, an adaptive behavioural strategy as: (1) divorce is triggered by relatively low breeding success; (2) there is a positive change in breeding success as a result of divorce. More specifically, while controlling for methodological moderators, we show that: (i) earlier stages of breeding are better predictors of divorce than later stages (r = 0.231; 95% CI: 0.061–0.391 for clutch size; similar for laying date); (ii) females benefited from divorce more than males in terms of increasing breeding success between successive breeding attempts, with different stages of the breeding cycle improving at different rates (e.g. r = 0.637; 95% CI: 0.328–0.817 for brood-level measures). We show that the effect size was dependent on the methodological approach used across studies and argue that research on the adaptive nature of divorce should be cautious when designing the study and interpreting the results. Altogether, by providing strong evidence that divorce is an adaptive strategy across monogamous birds, the results of our analysis provide a firm ground for further exploration of external covariates of divorce (e.g. demographic factors) and the mechanisms underlying the differences in the effect sizes of the proximal fitness causes and consequences of divorce.","2015-11","2018-07-25 04:17:36","2018-07-25 04:20:11","2018-07-25 04:17:36","1015-1034","","4","90","","","Trading up","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

Large carnivores are of particular importance in shaping community structure since they are at the top of the food chain, and many efforts are made to conserve such keystone species. Despite this, the mechanisms of carnivore interactions are far from understood, yet they are key to enabling or hindering their coexistence and hence are highly relevant for their conservation. The goal of this review is thus to provide detailed information on the extents of competition and facilitation between large carnivores and their impact in shaping their life histories. Here, we use the example of spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and lions (Panthera leo) and provide a comprehensive knowledge of their interactions based on meta-analyses from available literature (148 publications). Despite their strong potential for both exploitation and interference competition (range and diet overlap, intraguild predation and kleptoparasitism), we underline some mechanisms facilitating their coexistence (different prey-age selection and scavenging opportunities). We stress the fact that prey abundance is key to their coexistence and that hyaenas forming very large groups in rich ecosystems could have a negative impact on lions. We show that the coexistence of spotted hyaenas and lions is a complex balance between competition and facilitation, and that prey availability within the ecosystem determines which predator is dominant. However, there are still many gaps in our knowledge such as the spatio-temporal dynamics of their interactions. As both species' survival becomes increasingly dependent on protected areas, where their densities can be high, it is critical to understand their interactions to inform both reintroduction programs and protected area management.","2015-11","2018-07-25 04:27:23","2018-07-25 04:28:06","2018-07-25 04:27:23","1197-1214","","4","90","","","The Lion King and the Hyaena Queen","","","","","","","en","© 2014 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 224","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JUSG3TYK\brv12152-sup-0001-appendixs1.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DYY5ZBKM\Périquet et al. - The Lion King and the Hyaena Queen large carnivor.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ELJLS6IF\brv.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","predator; facilitation; interspecific competition; intraguild predation; Crocuta crocuta; kleptoparasitism; Panthera leo; scavenging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may, however, differ in long-lived diving homeotherms that frequently encounter hypoxic conditions and have very high metabolic rates. To examine ageing within a long-lived diving homeotherm, we studied resting metabolism and thyroid hormones (N = 43), blood oxygen stores (N = 93) and foraging behaviour (N = 230) of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia). Because murres dive exceptionally deep for their size and have a very high metabolism, we expected that ageing murres would show signs of physiological senescence. We paid particular attention to resting metabolism as we argue that these maintenance costs reflect those experienced during deep dives. Blood oxygen stores (haematocrit), resting metabolic rate and thyroid hormone levels all declined significantly with age in incubating murres 3–30 years of age. In birds measured longitudinally 3 years apart, thyroid hormone levels and haematocrit were both significantly lower, suggesting progressive changes within individuals rather than selective disappearance of individuals with high metabolic rates. Within our longitudinal data set, we found no effect of age on dive depth, dive shape or behavioural aerobic dive limit. A meta-analysis of changes in resting metabolism with age across 15 animal species demonstrated that such declines are pervasive across most of the kingdom. The rate of decline was highest in species with high energy expenditure supporting a linkage between metabolism and senescence. Physiological changes occurred in tandem with advancing age in murres, but offset each other such that there was no detectable decline in behavioural performance.","2015-02","2018-07-25 04:57:04","2018-07-25 04:57:48","2018-07-25 04:57:04","219-228","","2","29","","","Ageing gracefully","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

A battery of stress (salt, drought, heat shock, metals, etc.)-related genes were induced. Glutathione played a pivotal role in tolerance/detoxification, together with secondary metabolites ((iso)flavonoids and phenylpropanoids). However, antioxidant enzymes were not activated. Concerning the symbiotic interaction, molecular evidence suggesting that rhizobia alleviate As stress is for the first time provided. Chalcone synthase (which is involved in the first step of the legume–rhizobia cross-talk) was strongly enhanced, suggesting that the plants are biased to establish symbiotic interactions under As(III) stress. In contrast, 13 subsequent nodulation genes (involved in nodulation factors (Nod factors) perception, infection, thread initiation and progression, and nodule morphogenesis) were repressed. Overexpression of the ethylene responsive factor ERN in composite plants reduced root stress and partially restored nodulation, whereas overexpression of the early nodulin ENOD12 enhanced nodulation both in the presence and, particularly, in the absence of As, without affecting root elongation. Several transcription factors were identified, which could be additional targets for genetic engineering aiming to improve nodulation and/or alleviate root stress induced by this toxic.","2015-01","2018-07-25 05:46:13","2018-07-25 05:47:06","2018-07-25 05:46:13","255-272","","1","205","","","Unraveling the effect of arsenic on the model Medicago–Ensifer interaction","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

Understanding the ecosystem consequences of these changes is critical to effectively managing these systems. Over the last several years, numerous experimental manipulations of species richness have been performed, yet existing quantitative syntheses have focused on a just a subset of processes measured in experiments and, as such, have not summarized the full data available from marine systems. Here, we present the results of a meta-analysis of 110 marine experiments from 42 studies that manipulated the species richness of organisms across a range of taxa and trophic levels and analysed the consequences for various ecosystem processes (categorised as production, consumption or biogeochemical fluxes). Our results show that, generally, mixtures of species tend to enhance levels of ecosystem function relative to the average component species in monoculture, but have no effect or a negative effect on functioning relative to the ‘highest- performing’ species. These results are largely consistent with those from other syntheses, and extend conclusions to ecological functions that are commonly measured in the marine realm (e.g. nutrient release from sediment bioturbation). For experiments that manipulated three or more levels of richness, we attempted to discern the functional form of the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship. We found that, for response variables related to consumption, a power-function best described the relationship, which is also consistent with previous findings. However, we identified a linear relationship between richness and production. Combined, our results suggest that changes in the number of species will, on average, tend to alter the functioning of marine ecosystems. We outline several research frontiers that will allow us to more fully understand how, why, and when diversity may drive the functioning of marine ecosystems. Synthesis The oceans host an incredible number and variety of species. However, human activities are driving rapid changes in the marine environment. It is imperative we understand ecosystem consequences of any associated loss of species. We summarized data from 110 experiments that manipulated species diversity and evaluated resulting changes to a range of ecosystem responses. We show that losing species, on average, decreases productivity, growth, and a myriad of other processes related to how marine organisms capture and utilize resources. Finally, we suggest that the loss of species may have stronger consequences for some processes than others.","2015-03","2018-07-25 06:55:50","2018-07-25 06:56:26","2018-07-25 06:55:50","252-265","","3","124","","","Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 229","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XDRCUSXV\Appendix_oik.01549editnew.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\23CPEX7Y\Gamfeldt et al. - Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning wha.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4YSTP8AM\gamfeldt appendix 1ny.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\U3K8LWD2\gamfeldt appendix 2ny.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KBW7X54L\oik.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reliance on ecosystem services instead of synthetic, non-renewable inputs is increasingly seen as key to achieving food security in an environmentally sustainable way. This process, known as ecological intensification, will depend in large part on enhancing below-ground biological interactions that facilitate resource use efficiency. Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations formed between the roots of most terrestrial plant species and a specialized group of soil fungi, provide valuable ecosystem services, but the full magnitude of these services may not be fully realized under conventional intensively-managed annual agricultural systems.    2. Here we use meta-analysis to assess how reducing soil disturbance and periods without roots in agricultural systems affects the formation of AM and the diversity and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We compiled data from 54 field studies across five continents that measured effects of tillage and/or cover cropping on AMF colonization and/or communities and assessed effects of management and environmental factors on these responses.    3. Less intensive tillage and winter cover cropping similarly increased AMF colonization of summer annual cash crop roots by ~30%. The key variables influencing the change in AMF colonization were the type of cover crop or the type of alternative tillage, suggesting that farmers can optimize combinations of tillage and cover crops that most enhance AM formation, particularly with no-till systems and legume cover crops.    4. Richness of AMF taxa increased by 11% in low-intensity vs. conventional tillage regimes. Several studies showed changes in diversity and community composition of AMF with cover cropping, but these responses were not consistent.    5. Synthesis and applications. This meta-analysis indicates that less intensive tillage and cover cropping are both viable strategies for enhancing root colonization from indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) across a wide range of soil types and cash crop species, and possibly also shifting AMF community structure, which could in turn increase biologically-based resource use in agricultural systems.","2016-10-13","2018-08-01 23:46:30","2018-08-01 23:46:30","2018-08-01 23:46:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B644YMMZ\AMF colonization and cover crops and tillage.xlsx","","","meta-analysis; ecosystem services; cover crops; ecological intensification; tillage; roots; soil disturbance; arbuscular mycorrhizae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, a number of studies, including a highly cited meta-analysis, have concluded that the trend for such interactions is  ompetitive. Here we provide evidence that publication bias and study design have obscured our ability to  ssess the pollinator-mediated impacts of alien plants. In a meta-analysis of 76 studies, we demonstrate that  alien/native status does not predict the outcome of  pollinator-mediated interactions among plants.  oreover, we found no evidence that similarity in floral traits or phylogenetic distance between species pairs influences the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions. Instead, we report that aspects of study design, such as distance between the control and nearest neighbour, and/or the arrangement of study plants better predict the impact of a neighbour than does alien/native status. Our study sheds new light on  the role that publication bias and experimental design play in the evaluation of key patterns in ecology. We conclude that, due to the absence of clear,  generalisable pollinator-mediated impacts of alien  species, management schemes should base decisions  in community-wide assessments of the impacts of individual alien plant species, and not solely on alien/native status itself.","2017-09-12","2018-08-02 06:08:24","2018-08-02 06:08:24","2018-08-02 06:08:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8QFC28N5\C&S2017.Complete.Data.Set.csv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In cases where multiple defenses confer protection by independent means (i.e., they are  mechanistically independent) responses will either be co-expressed, or the expression of one defense will limit the capacity (or need) to respond along another axis. Our ability to generate a broad understanding of these patters has been limited, in part, by difficulties in comparing results across studies that employ distinct experimental protocols. Using the extensive literature on tadpole responses to PPR, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the ecological and experimental determinants of inducible defence expression. We then assessed whether the magnitude of response to PPR along behavioural versus morphological response axes was positively, or negatively, correlated. The most commonly quantified responses to perceived risk in tadpoles included reductions in movement and swimming behaviour, and altered tail morphology. Our analyses reveal that tadpole behavioural responses are strongly influenced by prey family, predator taxon, evolutionary history with the predator (native vs. non-native), amount of prey consumed by the predator, and how perceived risk was manipulated (e.g., presence vs. absence of alarm cues). Tail morphology was similarly influenced by these factors, but also whether the target prey was palatable to predators. Thus, our results identify ecological and experimental features that critically influence the observed effect size in tadpole responses to PPR. A positive correlation between behavioural and morphological responses in studies where both were measured indicates that trait co-specialization is the predominant pattern of defense deployment in larval amphibians. This positive relationship suggests that survival tends to be maximized in tadpoles through equivalent coactivation of multiple independent axes of protection, opposed to maximal expression along any single axis.","2016-08-13","2018-08-02 07:19:22","2018-08-02 07:19:22","2018-08-02 07:19:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NBAYSFHL\Hossie et al 2016 OIKOS - Dataset.xlsx","","","behaviour; morphology; phenotypic plasticity; anti-predator; inducible response; Tadpole","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed a meta-analysis to compare the strength of top-down and bottom-up forces on consumer fitness, considering multiple predictors that can modulate these effects: diet breadth, feeding guild, habitat/environment, type of bottom-up effects, type of top-down effects and how consumer fitness effects are measured. We focused our analyses on the most diverse group of primary consumers, herbivorous insects, and found that in general top-down forces were stronger than bottom-up forces. Notably, chewing, sucking and gall-making herbivores were more affected by top-down than bottom-up forces, top-down forces were stronger than bottom-up in both natural and controlled (cultivated) environments, and parasitoids and predators had equally strong top-down effects on insect herbivores. Future studies should broaden the scope of focal consumers, particularly in understudied terrestrial systems, guilds, taxonomic groups and top-down controls (e.g. pathogens), and test for more complex indirect community interactions. Our results demonstrate the surprising strength of forces exerted by natural enemies on herbivorous insects, and thus the necessity of using of a tri-trophic approach when studying insect-plant interactions.","2017-11-03","2018-08-02 07:27:55","2018-08-02 07:27:55","2018-08-02 07:27:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PUQYRMJT\README.doc; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5LEHF8N7\Vidal&Murphy_meta-analysis.xlsx","","","meta-analysis; fitness; herbivorous insects; host-plant quality; natural enemies; parasitoid; predator; top-down; bottom-up","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that the effect of biodiversity of AMF taxa depended on taxonomic resolution. Plant performance was positively promoted by AMF family richness, while no effect was found for fungal species richness. In addition, negative effect was found between AMF phylogenetic diversity and plant growth. This pattern can be explained by functional conservatism within AMF families and functional differentiation among AMF families.  Synthesis. Conservation of AMF communities to maintain a full complement of ecosystem functions requires the presence of diverse families and not simply diverse species within a family.

We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work, and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies (> 500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate).We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly used in the trait literature.To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling,sapling and adult. Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages.Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants.Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings,seedlings and adults,respectively. Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions,major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature.For example,for one third of the traits considered,the majority (> 75%) of reported correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage. Synthesis: We show for some traits, how trait-growth correlations change in a predictable way with plant size.Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.","2016-05-01","2018-08-07 03:22:08","2018-08-07 03:22:08","2018-08-07 03:22:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\49TUXGGR\CompileData.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B2BLFPZC\README.csv","","","functional trait; growth strategy; maximum height; ontogenetic stage; photosynthetic rate; seed mass; specific leaf area; wood density; Plant development and life-history traits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding of the mechanisms of Si-mediated stress alleviation is progressing, and several reviews have brought information together. A quantitative assessment of the alleviative capacity of Si, however, which could elucidate plant Si function more broadly, was lacking.  We combined the results of 145 experiments, predominantly on agricultural species, in a meta-analysis to statistically assess the responses of stressed plants to Si supply across multiple plant families and abiotic stresses. We interrogated our database to determine whether stressed plants increased in dry mass and net assimilation rate, oxidative stress markers were reduced, antioxidant responses were increased and whether element uptake showed consistent changes when supplied with Si.  We demonstrated that across plant families and stress types, Si increases dry weight, assimilation rate and chlorophyll biosynthesis and alleviates oxidative damage in stressed plants. In general, results indicated that plant family (as a proxy for accumulator type) and stress type had significant explanatory power for variation in responses. The consistent reduction in oxidative damage was not mirrored by consistent increases in antioxidant production, indicative of the several different stress alleviation mechanisms in which Si is involved. Silicon addition increased K in shoots, decreased As and Cd in roots and Na and Cd in shoots. Silicon addition did not affect Al, Ca or Mn concentration in shoots and roots of stressed plants. Plants had significantly lower concentrations of Si accumulated in shoots but not in roots when stressed.  Meta-analyses showed consistent alleviation by Si of oxidative damage caused by a range of abiotic stresses across diverse species. Our findings indicate that Si is likely to be a useful fertilizer for many crops facing a spectrum of abiotic stresses. Similarities in responses across families provide strong support for a role of Si in the alleviation of abiotic stress in natural systems, where it has barely been explored. We suggest this role may become more important under a changing climate and more experiments using non-agricultural species are now needed.","2016-07-07","2018-08-07 05:44:53","2018-08-07 05:44:53","2018-08-07 05:44:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LFAIAN3S\Data description for Cooke and Leishman.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3TNNAE4D\Effect size data.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XRV6HWKX\README.txt","","","oxidative stress; agriculture; heavy metal toxicity; silica; stress alleviation; silicon fertiliser","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide a global synthesis of consumer control of vegetation in coastal wetlands, where the domineering role of physical factors such as nutrient and salinity, rather than consumers, has been emphasized for decades. Using a dataset of 1748 measures of consumer effects reported in 443 experiments/observations on all continents except the Antarctica, we examine the generality of consumer control in salt marshes and mangroves globally. Our analyses show that salt marsh herbivores, including insects, snails, crabs, waterfowl, small mammals, and livestock, generally and often strongly suppress plant survival, aboveground biomass, and height, while their effects on plant density, belowground biomass, reproduction, and cover are more variable. These effects occur in forbs, grasses, and shrubs, and in both seedlings and adult plants. Herbivores additionally affect plant nutrient stoichiometry, and mediate plant interactions, though their effects on plant diversity are less consistent. Higher trophic levels also affect plants, as predators facilitate plant growth through trophic cascades that suppress grazer abundance and grazing rate. In mangroves, there are also signs of consumer control, though the relatively few studies available have often focused on mangrove propagules and seedlings rather than adults. Our analyses further reveal that the strength of consumer control is regulated by many physical factors. Nutrient, disturbance, and flooding, for example, amplify the negative effects of herbivores. Along latitudinal gradients, increased temperature enhances the negative effects of ectothermic herbivores, but has no effect on those of endothermic herbivores. Consumer control of coastal plants is also apparent across study methodologies: in field and laboratory settings, in observational studies, in consumer exclusion and addition experiments, in natural and transplanted plants, and in experiments of various durations. The role of consumer control in coastal vegetation worldwide highlights the need to better recognize and theoretically conceptualize both top-down and bottom-up forcing and their interactions in coastal wetlands. Improved understanding and conservation of coastal wetlands will only occur if we incorporate what the science has revealed: trophic feedbacks are an important and pervasive determinant of coastal plant communities.","2016-08-01","2018-08-07 05:56:56","2018-08-07 05:56:56","2018-08-07 05:56:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\F9426NAU\Dataset 1 Coastal wetland consumer effect synthesis All.xls; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5D3WXEDU\Dataset 2 Coastal wetland consumer effect synthesis Competition subset.xls; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7JX7YVZU\Dataset 3 Coastal wetland consumer effect synthesis Environmental factor subset.xls","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Invasive plants have been shown to reduce pollinator visitation to natives and increase pollen quantity limitation. However, visitation and conspecific pollen delivery are only two components of the pollination process; post-pollination interactions on the stigma (heterospecific pollen [HP] receipt) could intensify pre-pollination responses to invasion. Here we used meta-analysis to test the hypotheses that invasive plants are more detrimental as HP donors than natives ones, and that HP donors that are closely related to the recipients have stronger effects on fruit and seed production compared to distantly related ones. Invasive HP donors reduced fruit and seed production of recipients to a greater degree than native ones, and this was more intense for HP donors closely related to natives. Related donors were more detrimental overall. Synthesis: These results suggest that the total effect of invasive plants on native plant reproductive success could be greater than what is inferred from visitation and conspecific pollen transfer alone. Furthermore, these results indicate that invasive species can reduce reproductive success of native species even if pollinator visitation rates remain unaltered. Thus, we highlight the need to evaluate pre- and post-pollination processes in order to fully understand the potential effects of invasive species on the reproductive success and maintenance of native plant populations.","2016-04-07","2018-08-07 06:42:32","2018-08-07 06:42:32","2018-08-07 06:42:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GM3WI4SP\Data for submission JEcology_3_31_16.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YTZCFD47\README.rtf","","","invasive species; pollen transfer; pollinator sharing; Co-flowering; Invasion Ecology; Plant-plant interactions; plant-pollinator interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A global meta-analysis","","","","10.5061/dryad.kh6j6","","1. Indirect effects of large mammalian herbivores (LMH), while much less studied than those of apex predators, are increasingly recognized to exert powerful influences on communities and ecosystems. The strength of these effects is spatiotemporally variable, and several sets of authors have suggested that they are governed in part by primary productivity. However, prior theoretical and field studies have generated conflicting results and predictions, underscoring the need for a synthetic global analysis.  2. We conducted a meta-analysis of the direction and magnitude of large mammalian herbivore-initiated indirect interactions using 67 published studies comprising 456 individual responses. We georeferenced 41 of these studies (comprising 253 responses from 33 locations on 5 continents) to a satellite-derived map of primary productivity. Because predator assemblages might also influence the impact of large herbivores, we conducted a similar analysis using a global map of large-carnivore species richness.  3. In general, LMH reduced the abundance of other consumer species and also tended to reduce consumer richness, although the latter effect was only marginally significant.  4. There was a pronounced reduction in the strength of negative (i.e., suppressive, due e.g. to competition) indirect effects of LMH on consumer abundance in more productive ecosystems. In contrast, positive (facilitative) indirect effects were not significantly correlated with productivity, likely because these comprised a more heterogeneous array of mechanisms. We found no effect of carnivore species richness on herbivore-initiated indirect effect strength.  5. Our findings help to resolve the fundamental problem of ecological contingency as it pertains to the strength of an under-studied class of multi-trophic interactions. Moreover, these results will aid in predicting the indirect effects of anthropogenic wildlife declines and irruptions, and how these effects might be mediated by climatically driven shifts in resource availability. To the extent that intact ungulate guilds help to suppress populations of small animals that act as agricultural pests and disease reservoirs, the negative impacts of large-mammal declines on human well-being may be relatively stronger in low-productivity areas.","2016-03-23","2018-08-08 00:10:47","2018-08-08 00:10:47","2018-08-08 00:10:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QJIKFAUV\DaskinRawData_160225.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QP7VN8X8\README.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BMZWA8DC\SpatialWeightsMatrix_151224.csv","","","competition; context dependence; ecosystem engineers; large mammals; trophic cascades; ungulate herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current efforts to restore and create ecosystems require greater understanding of ecosystems’ responses to commonly used physical and biological intervention approaches to overcome ecological and technological limitations. 2. We estimated effect sizes from measurements of biotic assemblage structure and biogeochemical functions at 628 restored and created wetlands globally, in comparison with 499 reference wetlands. We studied the recovery trajectories of wetlands where different restoration or creation approaches were used under different environmental settings. 3. Although the variance explained by a linear mixed-effects models was low (6–7%), the study of recovery trajectories showed that the restoration or creation approach had no significant effects in most environmental settings. 4. In particular, wetlands where surface modification and flow re-establishment were used followed similar recovery trajectories regardless of whether they were revegetated or not. We even found potential detrimental effects of biological manipulations on the recovery of the plant assemblage, particularly in cold climates and in wetlands restored or created in agricultural areas. 5. Since physical interventions are required to recover or create the hydrological conditions of degraded or new wetlands, and given the high cost (22–73%) of biological interventions (i.e. revegetation), the need for biological interventions is, in most cases, unclear. 6. Our results highlight the urgent need to increase our understanding of the long-term effects of restoration and creation actions in our aim to engage in large-scale ecosystem management strategies for wetlands. 7. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that, currently, the recovery and development processes of restored and created wetlands can be driven by spontaneous processes rather than by the response of wetlands to human interventions other than those targeted to restore hydrological conditions that existed prior to disturbance.

A recent synthesis addressing this issue found conflicting evidence for the relationship between diet breadth and mean individual fitness. Specifically, that analysis found that whilst on average a mixed diet does increase mean fitness, in some instances a single food provides equal (or higher) fitness than a mixed diet. Critical to ecological and evolutionary considerations of diet, however, is not only average, but also variance in fitness. We combine contemporary meta-analytic methods with models of nutritional geometry to evaluate how diet affects between-individual variance in fitness within generalist consumers from a range of trophic levels. As predicted by nutritional geometry, we found that between-individual variance in fitness-related traits is higher on single-food than mixed-food diets. The effect was strong for longevity (57% higher) and reproductive traits (37%), and present but weaker for size-related traits (10%). Further, the effect became stronger as the number of available foods increased. The availability of multiple foods likely allows individuals with differing nutritional optima to customise intake, each maximising their own fitness. Importantly, these findings may suggest that selection on traits correlated with nutritional requirements is weak in heterogeneous nutritional environments.","2015-09-28","2018-08-08 00:33:42","2018-08-08 00:33:42","2018-08-08 00:33:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P4UWFKM3\Code.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HF5U73EL\Data.Objects.Rdata","","","Ecology: statistical; Fitness; Foraging: behavior; Foraging: ecology; Foraging: theory; Methods: meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluate evidence for population differentiation, natural selection and adaptive evolution of invading plants and animals at two nested spatial scales: (i) among introduced populations (ii) between native and introduced genotypes. Evolution during invasion is frequently inferred, but rarely confirmed as adaptive. In common garden studies, quantitative trait differentiation is only marginally lower (~3.5%) among introduced relative to native populations, despite genetic bottlenecks and shorter timescales (i.e. millennia vs. decades). However, differentiation between genotypes from the native vs. introduced range is less clear and confounded by nonrandom geographic sampling; simulations suggest this causes a high false-positive discovery rate (>50%) in geographically structured populations. Selection differentials (¦s¦) are stronger in introduced than in native species, although selection gradients (¦β¦) are not, consistent with introduced species experiencing weaker genetic constraints. This could facilitate rapid adaptation, but evidence is limited. For example, rapid phenotypic evolution often manifests as geographical clines, but simulations demonstrate that nonadaptive trait clines can evolve frequently during colonization (~two-thirds of simulations). Additionally, QST-FST studies may often misrepresent the strength and form of natural selection acting during invasion. Instead, classic approaches in evolutionary ecology (e.g. selection analysis, reciprocal transplant, artificial selection) are necessary to determine the frequency of adaptive evolution during invasion and its influence on establishment, spread and impact of invasive species. These studies are rare but crucial for managing biological invasions in the context of global change.","2015-04-20","2018-08-08 00:55:03","2018-08-08 00:55:03","2018-08-08 00:55:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QBC8I9EU\ClinesModel.r; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XR7S6RVN\MetaPCA_Analysis.r; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GPLJZU8H\MetaPCA_Data.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S9MWVDE3\README_MetaPCA_Data.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RVMGKD64\README_Selection_Data.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PJLLVH9Q\README_SpatialStructure_Data.txt; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UT3AKK3C\Selection_Analysis.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5JSY3WV3\Selection_Data.csv; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TJR322WJ\SpatialStructure_Analysis.R; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PH75VRF2\SpatialStructure_Data.csv","","","Adaptation; Quantitative Genetics; Contemporary Evolution; Ecological Genetics; Invasive Species; Natural Selection and Contemporary Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parents that are able to transmit information to their offspring about prevailing environmental conditions have a selective advantage by ‘priming’ the physiology of their offspring. We used a meta-analytic approach to test the effect of parental diet on offspring immune responses. Using the geometric framework for nutrition (a method for analysing diet compositions wherein food nutrient components are expressed as axes in a Cartesian coordinate space) to define dietary manipulations in terms of their energy and macronutrient compositions, we compiled the results of 226 experiments from 38 published papers on the intergenerational effects of diet on immunity, across a range of study species and immunological responses. We observed intergenerational impacts of parental nutrition on a number of offspring immunological processes, including expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers as well as decreases in anti-inflammatory markers in response to certain parental diets. For example, across our data set as a whole (encompassing several types of dietary manipulation), dietary stress in parents was seen to significantly increase pro-inflammatory cytokine levels measured in offspring (overall d = 0.575). All studies included in our analysis were from experiments in which the offspring were raised on a normal or control diet, so our findings suggest that a nutrition-dependent immune state can be inherited, and that this immune state is maintained in the short term, despite offspring returning to an ‘optimal’ diet. We demonstrate how the geometric framework for nutrition can be used to disentangle the role that different forms of dietary manipulation can have on intergenerational immunity. For example, offspring B-cell responses were significantly decreased when parents were raised on a range of different diets. Similarly, our approach allowed us to show that a parental diet elevated in protein (regardless of energy composition and relative to a control diet) can increase expression of inflammatory markers while decreasing B-cell-associated markers. By conducting a systematic review of the literature, we have identified important gaps that impair our understanding of the intergenerational effects of diet, such as a paucity of experimental studies involving increased protein and decreased energy, and a lack of studies directed at the whole-organism consequences of these processes, such as immune resilience to infection. The results of our analyses inform our understanding of the effects of diet on physiological state across diverse biological fields, including biomedical sciences, maintenance of agricultural breed stock and conservation breeding programs, among others.","2018-05-01","2018-08-21 06:17:59","2018-08-21 06:19:08","2018-08-21 06:17:59","1108-1124","","2","93","","","Intergenerational effects of nutrition on immunity","","","","","","","en","© 2017 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSA SearchResultID: 062","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Q89IBSRN\brv12387-sup-0001-appendixs1.xlsx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZV2ULCL6\brv12387-sup-0002-appendixs2.r; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VT8ZSW8R\brv12387-sup-0003-appendixs3.docx; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IYI28HN9\Grueber et al. - 2018 - Intergenerational effects of nutrition on immunity.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MF4TF2CB\brv.html","","Scopus Search A: Meta-analysis","cytokines; diet composition; inflammation; macronutrients; nutritional geometry; obesity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Proportional (isometric) scaling where large and small individuals are magnified versions of each other is often assumed the most common way morphological traits scale relative to overall size within species. However, the many traits showing non-proportional (allometric) scaling have motivated some of the most discussed hypotheses on scaling relationships in biology, like the positive allometry hypothesis for secondary sexual traits and the negative allometry hypothesis for genitals. I evaluate more than 3200 allometric parameters from the literature and find that negative allometry, not isometry, is the expected scaling relationship of morphological traits within species. Slopes of secondary sexual traits are more often steeper compared to other traits, but slopes larger than unity is also common for traits not under sexual selection. The steepness of the allometric slope is accordingly a weak predictor of past and present patterns of selection. Scaling of genitals varies across taxonomic groups, but negative allometry of genitals in insects and spiders is a consistent pattern. Lastly, I find indications that terrestrial organisms have an overall different scaling of morphological traits compared to aquatic species.","2015-11-16","2019-01-15 05:03:07","2019-01-15 05:03:07","2019-01-15 05:03:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Dryad Digital Repository","","datadryad.org","","{:itemType: dataset}","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5WYVC282\allometry_data.xlsx","","","Adaptation; Allometry; Evolution: developmental; Morphology; Selection: natural; Selection: sexual","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grazing management practices that incorporate periods of planned rest (i.e. strategic-rest grazing) may be an alternative to grazing exclusion or continuous grazing that could achieve ecological and animal production outcomes simultaneously. We conducted a meta-analysis of global literature to investigate how strategic-rest grazing mediates ecological (i.e., plant richness and diversity), biophysical (plant biomass and ground cover) and production response variables (animal weight gain and animal production per hectare) compared to continuously grazed or ungrazed areas. Overall, total ground cover and animal production per hectare were significantly greater under strategic-rest grazing than continuous grazing management, but biomass, plant richness, plant diversity and animal weight gain did not differ between grazing treatments. Increasing the length of rest relative to graze time under strategic-rest grazing was associated with an increase in plant biomass, ground cover, animal weight gain and animal production per hectare when compared to continuous grazing. Synthesis and applications. Understanding both the ecological and animal production trade-offs associated with different grazing management strategies is essential to make informed decisions about best-management practices for the world's grazing lands. We show that incorporating periods of rest into grazing regimes improves ground cover and animal production per hectare and that these benefits are more pronounced with increases in the length of time land is rested for. This extended rest also improves biomass production and weight gain compared to continuous grazing systems. Based on these meta-analyses, we recommend that future research considers the duration of rest compared to graze time in comparisons of grazing systems.","2019","2020-08-04 14:29:57","2020-08-04 14:32:29","2020-08-04 14:29:57","2723-2731","","12","56","","","Ecological, biophysical and production effects of incorporating rest into grazing regimes","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

However, comprehensive tests for an effect of assortative mating on species richness at the macroevolutionary scale are lacking. We used a meta-analytic approach to test the hypothesis that the strength of assortative mating within populations is positively related to species richness across a broad range of animal taxa. Specifically, we ran a phylogenetically independent meta-analysis using an extensive database of 1,447 effect sizes for the strength of assortative mating, encompassing 307 species from 130 families and 14 classes. Our results suggest that there is no relationship between the strength of assortative mating and species richness across and within major taxonomic groups and trait categories.

Ecologists use many different study designs to monitor such impacts. Simpler designs lacking controls (e.g. Before–After (BA) and After) or pre-impact data (e.g. Control–Impact (CI)) are considered to be less robust than more complex designs (e.g. Before–After Control-Impact (BACI) or Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)). However, we lack quantitative estimates of how much less accurate simpler study designs are in ecology. Understanding this could help prioritize research and weight studies by their design's accuracy in meta-analysis and evidence assessment. We compared how accurately five study designs estimated the true effect of a simulated environmental impact that caused a step-change response in a population's density. We derived empirical estimates of several simulation parameters from 47 ecological datasets to ensure our simulations were realistic. We measured design performance by determining the percentage of simulations where: (a) the true effect fell within the 95% Confidence Intervals of effect size estimates, and (b) each design correctly estimated the true effect's direction and magnitude. We also considered how sample size affected their performance. We demonstrated that BACI designs performed: 1.3–1.8 times better than RCTs; 2.9–4.2 times versus BA; 3.2–4.6 times versus CI; and 7.1–10.1 times versus After designs (depending on sample size), when correctly estimating true effect's direction and magnitude to within ±30%. Although BACI designs suffered from low power at small sample sizes, they outperformed other designs for almost all performance measures. Increasing sample size improved BACI design accuracy, but only increased the precision of simpler designs around biased estimates. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that more investment in more robust designs is needed in ecology since inferences from simpler designs, even with large sample sizes may be misleading. Facilitating this requires longer-term funding and stronger research–practice partnerships. We also propose ‘accuracy weights’ and demonstrate how they can weight studies in three recent meta-analyses by accounting for study design and sample size. We hope these help decision-makers and meta-analysts better account for study design when assessing evidence.","2019","2020-08-04 14:51:29","2020-08-04 14:52:08","2020-08-04 14:51:29","2742-2754","","12","56","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

However, ants may provide additional services. In a review of published studies on ant–pathogen–plant interactions, we investigated whether ants’ extensive hygiene measures, including the use of ant-produced antibiotics, extend to their host plants and reduce plant pathogen loads. From 30 reported species combinations, we found that the presence of ants lead to reduced pathogen levels in 18 combinations and to increased levels in 6. On average, ants significantly reduced pathogen incidence with 59%. This effect size did not differ significantly from effect sizes reported from meta-analyses on herbivore protection. Thus, pathogen and herbivore protection could be of equal importance in ant–plant mutualisms. Considering the abundance of these interactions, ecological impacts are potentially high. Furthermore, awareness of this service may stimulate the development of new measures to control plant diseases in agriculture. It should be noted, though, that studies were biased toward tropical ant–plant symbioses and that the literature in the field is limited at present.

We synthesized data on contemporary phenotypic responses of angiosperms to environmental change and show that if extinction does not occur, quantitative traits change quickly in the first few years following the environmental novelty and then remain stable. This general pattern is independent from life span, growth form, spatial scale, or the type of trait. Our work shows that high amounts and rates of phenotypic change at contemporary timescales observed in plants are consistent with the pattern of stasis and bounded evolution previously observed over longer time frames. We also found evidence that may contradict some common ideas about phenotypic evolution: (1) the total amount of phenotypic change observed does not differ significantly according to growth form or life span; (2) greater and faster divergence tends to occur between populations connected at the local scale, where gene flow could be intense, rather than between distant populations; and (3) traits closely related to fitness change as much and as fast as other traits.","2019-12-01","2020-08-04 14:57:16","2020-08-04 14:58:00","2020-08-04 14:57:16","840-853","","6","194","","The American Naturalist","","","","","","","","","","","","","www-journals-uchicago-edu.eu1.proxy.openathens.net (Atypon)","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB005 Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MYS4IECN\Gorné and Díaz - 2019 - Meta-analysis Shows That Rapid Phenotypic Change i.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5JIQ78RW\705680.html","","Scopus Search B","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, we do not have a predictive framework for understanding which plant species are sensitive to different AM fungal species. In two greenhouse studies, we tested for differences in plant sensitivity to different AM fungal species and mycorrhizal responsiveness across 17 grassland plant species of North America that varied in successional stage, native status, and plant family by growing plants with different AM fungal treatments including eight single AM fungal isolates, diverse mixtures of AM fungi, and non-inoculated controls. We found that late successional grassland plant species were highly responsive to AM fungi and exhibited stronger sensitivity in their response to individual AM fungal taxa compared to nonnative or early successional native grassland plant species. We confirmed these results using a meta-analysis that included 13 experiments, 37 plant species, and 40 fungal isolates (from nine publications and two greenhouse experiments presented herein). Mycorrhizal responsiveness and sensitivity of response (i.e., variation in plant biomass response to different AM fungal taxa) did not differ by the source of fungal inocula (i.e., local or not local) or plant family. Sensitivity of plant response to AM fungal species was consistently correlated with the average mycorrhizal response of that plant species. This study identifies that AM fungal identity is more important to the growth of late successional plant species than early successional or nonnative plant species, thereby predicting that AM fungal composition will be more important to plant community dynamics in late successional communities than in early successional or invaded plant communities.","2019","2020-08-04 14:58:49","2020-08-04 14:59:22","2020-08-04 14:58:49","e02855","","12","100","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

Species loss, however, is not the sole ecological cause of ecosystem function loss: behaviours underpinning ecosystem function can also be disrupted by anthropogenic pressures without detectable declines of component species (‘cryptic function loss’). Here, we introduce a novel framework that integrates behavioural responses into community disassembly metrics. We applied this framework to freshwater mussel communities (order Unionida) of the midwestern United States, in which intensive agricultural land use threatens stream biota. We combined a field experiment, meta-analysis and watershed-scale population dataset to assess how excessive sediment concentrations, one of the leading drivers of freshwater biodiversity loss, influence community-level water clearance rates of freshwater mussels via behavioural (changes in mass-specific clearance rate) and population (changes in population density) responses. Our study provided three key insights. First, freshwater mussels exhibited high behavioural sensitivity to increased total suspended solids (TSS) across species (i.e. reduced water clearance rate), whereas population responses were highly species-specific. Second, the behavioural response to increased TSS causes substantial cryptic function loss under stressful conditions: simulated water clearance rates when behavioural response is included can be less than half that of mussel communities with no behavioural response. Finally, simulations revealed that mussel communities are likely to show rapid but consistent rates of ecosystem function loss irrespective of disassembly rules. The similar rates of function loss are due to the uniform behavioural response to TSS that masks the linkage between population sensitivity of a species and its contribution to ecosystem function. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that ignoring behavioural processes may cause non-negligible underestimation of ecosystem function loss during community disassembly, potentially leading to overly optimistic assessments of ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, unlike species declines or local extinctions, behaviour response tied to function loss may occur concurrently with increasing anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, managers should acknowledge the risk of immediate function loss after human-induced environmental changes.","2019","2020-08-04 15:01:13","2020-08-04 15:01:57","2020-08-04 15:01:13","2710-2722","","12","56","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

There is an urgent need to predict landscape variation in forest restoration success at a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis comprising 135 study landscapes to predict and map landscape variation in forest restoration success in tropical and temperate forest biomes. Our analysis was based on the amount of forest cover within a landscape — a key driver of forest restoration success. We contrasted 17 generalized linear models measuring forest cover at different landscape sizes (with buffers varying from 5 to 200 km radii). We identified the most plausible model to predict and map landscape variation in forest restoration success. We then weighted landscape variation by the amount of potentially restorable areas (agriculture and pasture land areas) within the same landscape. Finally, we estimated restoration costs of implementing Bonn Challenge commitments in three specific temperate and tropical forest biome types in the United States, Brazil and Uganda. Landscape variation decreased exponentially as the amount of forest cover increased in the landscape, with stronger effects within a 5 km radius. Thirty-eight per cent of forest biomes have landscapes with more than 27% of forest cover and showed levels of landscape variation below 10%. Landscapes with less than 6% of forest cover showed levels of variation in forest restoration success above 50%. At the biome level, Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests had the lowest (12.6%), whereas Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests had the highest (22.9%) average of weighted landscape variation in forest restoration success. Our approach can lead to a reduction in implementation costs for each Bonn Challenge commitment between US$ 973 Mi and 9.9 Bi. Policy implications. Our approach identifies landscape characteristics that increase the likelihood of biodiversity recovery during forest restoration — and potentially the chances of natural regeneration and long-term ecological sustainability and functionality. Identifying areas with low levels of landscape variation can help to reduce the risks and financial costs associated with implementing ambitious restoration commitments.","2019","2020-08-04 15:03:05","2020-08-04 15:03:45","2020-08-04 15:03:05","2675-2686","","12","56","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

Marine turtles comprise an ecological radiation in which interspecific differences in trophic morphology have similarly been implicated as a pathway to ecopartition the marine realm, in both extant and extinct species. Because marine turtles are charismatic flagship species of conservation concern, their trophic ecology has been studied intensively using stable isotope analyses to gain insights into habitat use and diet, principally to inform conservation management. This legion of studies provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine ecological partitioning across numerous hierarchical levels that heretofore has not been applied to any other ecological radiation. Our contribution aims to provide a quantitative analysis of interspecific variation and a comprehensive review of intraspecific variation in trophic ecology across different hierarchical levels marshalling insights about realised trophic ecology derived from stable isotopes. We reviewed 113 stable isotope studies, mostly involving single species, and conducted a meta-analysis of data from adults to elucidate differences in trophic ecology among species. Our study reveals a more intricate hierarchy of ecopartitioning by marine turtles than previously recognised based on trophic morphology and dietary analyses. We found strong statistical support for interspecific partitioning, as well as a continuum of intraspecific trophic sub-specialisation in most species across several hierarchical levels. This ubiquity of trophic specialisation across many hierarchical levels exposes a far more complex view of trophic ecology and resource-axis exploitation than suggested by species diversity alone. Not only do species segregate along many widely understood axes such as body size, macrohabitat, and trophic morphology but the general pattern revealed by isotopic studies is one of microhabitat segregation and variation in foraging behaviour within species, within populations, and among individuals. These findings are highly relevant to conservation management because they imply ecological non-exchangeability, which introduces a new dimension beyond that of genetic stocks which drives current conservation planning. Perhaps the most remarkable finding from our data synthesis is that four of six marine turtle species forage across several trophic levels. This pattern is unlike that seen in other large marine predators, which forage at a single trophic level according to stable isotopes. This finding affirms suggestions that marine turtles are robust sentinels of ocean health and likely stabilise marine food webs. This insight has broader significance for studies of marine food webs and trophic ecology of large marine predators. Beyond insights concerning marine turtle ecology and conservation, our findings also have broader implications for the study of ecological radiations. Particularly, the unrecognised complexity of ecopartitioning beyond that predicted by trophic morphology suggests that this dominant approach in adaptive radiation research likely underestimates the degree of resource overlap and that interspecific disparities in trophic morphology may often over-predict the degree of realised ecopartitioning. Hence, our findings suggest that stable isotopes can profitably be applied to study other ecological radiations and may reveal trophic variation beyond that reflected by trophic morphology.","2019","2020-08-04 15:04:51","2020-08-04 15:05:26","2020-08-04 15:04:51","1947-1973","","6","94","","","Beyond trophic morphology","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

It was found that transgenerational effects generally enhanced offspring performance in response to both stressful and benign conditions. The strongest effects are in annual plants and invertebrates, whereas vertebrates appear to benefit mostly under benign conditions, and perennial plants show hardly any transgenerational responses at all. These differences among taxonomic/life-history groups possibly reflect that vertebrates can avoid stressful conditions through their mobility, and longer-lived plants have alternative strategies. In addition to environmental contexts and taxonomic/life-history groups, transgenerational effects also varied among traits and developmental stages of ancestors and offspring, but the effects were similarly strong across three generations of offspring. By way of a more comprehensive data set and a different effect size, our results differ from those of a recent meta-analysis, suggesting that transgenerational effects are widespread, strong and persistent and can substantially impact the responses of plants and animals to changing environments.","2019","2020-08-04 15:13:39","2020-08-04 15:14:09","2020-08-04 15:13:39","1976-1986","","11","22","","","Transgenerational effects benefit offspring across diverse environments","","","","","","","en","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB011 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ele.13373","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VGIUVKR3\Yin et al. - 2019 - Transgenerational effects benefit offspring across.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RLSSCI2K\ele.html","","Scopus Search B","meta-analysis; Fluctuating environment; parental effect; transgenerational effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How these changes are linked to soil enzyme activities is still unknown, however, even though these are proximate agents of organic matter decomposition and nutrient release. We performed a meta-analysis of 60 case studies examining responses of 10 unique soil enzymes to plant invasion, and tested whether invaded soils differed in their enzyme activities from uninvaded soils. We also examined whether increases in soil nutrient-releasing enzyme activity were paralleled by enhanced soil nutrient availability after plant invasion. Overall, we found that plant invasion had significant impacts on the activities of seven types of soil enzymes. Plant invasion had inconsistent impacts on C-decomposing enzymes, but invaded sites had significantly higher activities of soil enzymes related to N- and P-release than noninvaded sites. Increases in nutrient-releasing enzyme activity after plant invasion ranged from +23% to +69%, which potentially results in a linear increase of soil nutrient availability in response to enhanced enzyme activities. Invaded soils also had higher nutrient stocks and soil microbial biomass than uninvaded soils. Our results suggest that enhanced activity of soil nutrient-releasing enzymes after plant invasion may accelerate nutrient cycling, potentially creating a nutrient-rich soil environment that benefits invaders and promotes their persistence, as invasive plants often appear to be more resource-demanding and competitive than native species.","2019","2020-08-04 15:15:30","2020-08-04 15:16:06","2020-08-04 15:15:30","e02830","","11","100","","","Enhanced activity of soil nutrient-releasing enzymes after plant invasion","","","","","","","en","© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB012 _eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecy.2830","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RGFQTDVD\Zhou and Staver - 2019 - Enhanced activity of soil nutrient-releasing enzym.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RF9KFSFS\ecy.html","","Scopus Search B","meta-analysis; effect size; Hedges’ d; nutrient availability; nutrient release; plant invasion; soil enzyme activity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early vascular plants likely colonized land occupied by biocrusts — photoautotrophic, surface-dwelling soil communities comprised of cyanobacteria, bryophytes, lichens and fungi — suggesting biotic interactions between biocrusts and plants have been at play for some 2,000 million years. Today, biocrusts coexist with plants in dryland ecosystems worldwide, and have been shown to both facilitate or inhibit plant species performance depending on ecological context. Yet, the factors that drive the direction and magnitude of these effects remain largely unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant responses to biocrusts using a global dataset encompassing 1,004 studies from six continents. Meta-analysis revealed there is no simple positive or negative effect of biocrusts on plants. Rather, plant responses differ by biocrust composition and plant species traits and vary across plant ontogeny. Moss-dominated biocrusts facilitated, while lichen-dominated biocrusts inhibited overall plant performance. Plant responses also varied among plant functional groups: C4 grasses received greater benefits from biocrusts compared to C3 grasses, and plants without N-fixing symbionts responded more positively to biocrusts than plants with N-fixing symbionts. Biocrusts decreased germination but facilitated growth of non-native plant species. Synthesis. Results suggest that interspecific variation in plant responses to biocrusts, contingent on biocrust type, plant traits, and ontogeny can have strong impacts on plant species performance. These findings have important implications for understanding biocrust contributions to plant productivity and community assembly processes in ecosystems worldwide.","2019","2020-08-04 15:17:20","2020-08-04 15:17:59","2020-08-04 15:17:20","2789-2807","","6","107","","","Towards a predictive framework for biocrust mediation of plant performance","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

In particular, it is not clear when extreme droughts will elicit extreme ecological responses. For this study, we employed three complementary approaches to explore the relationships between extreme drought and ecosystem responses. First, we used global data mining to evaluate the relationship between extreme gross primary productivity and extreme precipitation from 1980 to 2013. Second, we conducted a meta-analysis using 132 drought experiments across the globe to assess the response ratios (RRs) of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) to extreme versus non-extreme drought treatments. Third, we examined community and ecosystem responses in an alpine meadow to a drought gradient experiment, which included five precipitation treatment levels (1/12 P, 1/4 P, 1/2 P, 3/4 P, and P, where P is the growing season precipitation). This study had three key results. In our historical data mining, we found that extreme droughts elicited extreme ecological responses only 15.1% of the time. The meta-analysis results indicated that there were no significant differences in the RRs of ANPP between the extreme versus non-extreme drought treatments. The drought gradient experiment results revealed that although the four drought treatments were statistically extreme, only the most extreme drought treatment (1/12 P) significantly reduced ANPP over the 3 years. Meanwhile, species richness and asynchrony were significantly reduced under the 1/12 P treatment, which led to a significant reduction in productivity. Synthesis. These results suggest that extreme ecological responses to extreme drought may be less frequent than previously thought. But when they do occur, extreme ecological responses may be driven by plant community changes such as species asynchrony, species loss or species reordering. Our experimental results highlight the key role of community dynamics in determining the resistance of ecosystem productivity to extreme drought, which should be assessed when predicting ecological responses to climate change.","2019","2020-08-04 15:18:39","2020-08-04 15:19:14","2020-08-04 15:18:39","2553-2563","","6","107","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

How this strong and predictable selection pressure has shaped plant defence syndromes remains unclear. Specifically, whether young leaf herbivory has led to general global patterns of shifting leaf defences during leaf development (i.e. ontogenetic trajectories) remains unknown but likely. Using meta-analysis, we have synthesized developmental shifts in chemical, physical and indirect defence traits, as well as leaf nutrient content, during leaf expansion and maturation across 124 woody plant species. Leaf traits were compared for immature young leaves vs. mature leaves within studies, and these developmental shifts were then compared across studies to characterize general patterns. Traits shifted strongly during leaf maturation, giving rise to discrete defence syndromes, with young leaves having significantly greater nutrient and secondary chemistry concentrations but reduced toughness and indirect defence traits than mature leaves. These patterns corroborate a growing consensus on the importance of ontogeny in plant defences, illustrating ontogenetic trajectories at the scale of leaves. Trait developmental shifts were stronger in species with synchronous than asynchronous leaf flushing, but whether this reflects variation across biomes remains unclear. Future research on under-studied traits, such as alkaloids, cyanogenesis, leaf phosphorus content and indirect defence traits, and in a more biogeographic context will provide additional insights into the generality of shifts in defence syndromes during leaf development.

The added nutrients include nitrogen (N) in 36 experiments, phosphorus (P) in 33 experiments, calcium and potassium in one experiment each, and various mixtures of essential nutrients in the remaining experiments. I evaluate the hypotheses that nutrients limit tropical forest plants, nutrient limitation is stronger in successional than in old-growth forests, P but not N is limiting in lowland forests, and N is limiting in montane forests. Responses to the most complete nutrient mix used in each experiment were strong for plant functions that contribute to aboveground production (Hedges’ g averages 0.87) and nonsignificant for fine root biomass. Responses to N addition and to P addition were strong for tissue concentrations of the added element (Hedges’ g averages 0.75 and 1.4, respectively), moderate for fine litter production (0.64 and 0.65, respectively), moderate to weak for plant growth (0.46 and 0.37, respectively) and nonsignificant for fine root biomass. Growth responses were stronger in successional than in old-growth forests. All responses were unrelated to elevation. The 48 experiments included 30 factorial nitrogen-phosphorus experiments that enable additional direct tests of the widely cited hypotheses that P limitation is stronger than N limitation in lowland forests and vice versa in montane forests. Both hypotheses were rejected. The N × P interaction effect was nonsignificant across the factorial experiments. In conclusion, nutrients clearly limit tropical forest plants. Limitation by N is widespread in both lowland and montane forests, and the same is true for P. Single experiments identify limitation by calcium and potassium, and correlative studies suggest limitation by calcium, potassium, and magnesium. The available evidence is consistent with the possibility that most macronutrients limit tropical forest plants; however, experiments focus almost exclusively on N and P. The way forward will include taking fuller advantage of existing nutrient addition experiments, siting new experiments strategically, and developing cost-effective methods to assay responses to all of the essential nutrients soils supply to plants.","2019","2020-08-04 15:21:50","2020-08-04 15:22:31","2020-08-04 15:21:50","e01382","","4","89","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB016 _eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecm.1382","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IE3P8BG7\Wright - 2019 - Plant responses to nutrient addition experiments c.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7JIL9CRR\ecm.html","","Scopus Search B","meta-analysis; nutrient limitation; nitrogen; phosphorus; fertilization; calcium; aboveground production; fine litter production; fine root biomass; potassium; tree growth rates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although ANPP has been extensively studied across the ecosystems, there is a little consensus on how the spatiotemporal patterns of ANPP will be altered with increasing drought stress. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of ANPP and the four variables (610 observations from 78 studies) for drought duration, intensity and their combination. Forest-ANPP had stronger negative responses to long-term drought (34.44%; ≥4 years) than short-term drought (10.78%; ≤1 year) and decreased more in Mediterranean forests than in tropical forests. Decreases in Pn and gs were strongest under long-term moderate drought. In the short term, Rs increased by 5.66% under light drought, but decreased by 14.12% and 28.43% under moderate and severe droughts. Grass-ANPP showed a nonlinear decrease with extended duration and the rate slowed. Within light to severe intensities, ANPP decreased linearly, but became stable under extreme condition. In the short term, ANPP reduced more seriously with increasing drought intensity (12.01%-30.34%). With aggravation of drought stress, the reductions in Rs and SWC increased. There was significant heterogeneity in grassland responses to drought stress. The greatest decreases in ANPP, Pn and gs were observed in North America, and the reductions in Rs and SWC were greater in Western Europe. Shrub-ANPP showed stronger negative responses to long-term moderate drought (12.59%). Pn and gs declined significantly with increasing drought intensity. Variations in Rs to drought duration, intensity and their combination were more complex, either showing positive or negative responses (dominated). Synthesis. Forest-ANPP shows high sensitivity to long-term moderate drought, whereas grass-ANPP is more responsive to short-term drought. Compared to forests and grasslands, shrub-ANPP exhibits less sensitivity to droughts. Different responses of ecosystems were predominantly driven by physiological mechanisms or species differences in turnover time, community architecture and drought adaptation strategies. Given these findings, future studies should focus on nonlinear patterns, response thresholds and adaptation mechanisms when predicting and modeling feedback between ecosystems and climate change.","2019","2020-08-04 15:23:39","2020-08-04 15:24:09","2020-08-04 15:23:39","2519-2531","","6","107","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

This non-resource effect of matter on ecosystems can lead to disturbances and to pulsed release and transport of matter over regional scales. However, non-resource effects of endogenous pulses of matter on meta-ecosystem stability and function remain largely unknown. Using a two-patch meta-ecosystem model of mussel bed dynamics, we show that non-resource effects of matter on the structural stability of mussel beds promote pulsed releases of matter and fluctuations in population abundance. These pulsed fluctuations explain the maintenance of meta-ecosystem heterogeneity in the distribution of abundance and matter through out-of-phase synchrony and asynchrony over a broad range of connectivity.

We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed evidence for age-related changes in immunity in captive and free-living populations of wild species (321 effect sizes in 62 studies across 44 species of mammals, birds and reptiles). As in humans, senescence was more evident in adaptive (acquired) than innate immune functions. Declines were evident for cell function (antibody response), the relative abundance of naïve immune cells and an in vivo measure of overall immune responsiveness (local response to phytohaemagglutinin injection). Inflammatory markers increased with age, similar to chronic inflammation associated with human immunosenescence. Comparisons across taxa and captive vs free-living animals were difficult due to lack of overlap in parameters and species measured. Most studies are cross-sectional, which yields biased estimates of age-effects when immune function co-varies with survival. We therefore suggest longitudinal sampling approaches, and highlight techniques from human cohort studies that can be incorporated into ecological research. We also identify avenues to address predictions from evolutionary theory and the contribution of immunosenescence to age-related increases in disease susceptibility and mortality.","2019","2020-08-04 15:27:02","2020-08-04 15:27:32","2020-08-04 15:27:02","1709-1722","","10","22","","","Immunosenescence in wild animals","","","","","","","en","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB019 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ele.13343","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XS4ADJDH\Peters et al. - 2019 - Immunosenescence in wild animals meta-analysis an.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YFQCMC93\ele.html","","Scopus Search B","ageing; Adaptive immunity; eco-immunology; gerontology; immune senescence; inflammaging; innate immunity; life-history trade-offs; PHA; senescence; wildlife diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to explore whether allometric scaling principles can provide an underlying framework for general patterns of resource patch use. To this end, we used giving-up densities (GUDs), that is, the amount of resources remaining in a patch after a forager has quit feeding, as a comparative measure of the amount of resources exploited by a forager of any given size. We specifically tested the hypothesis that size-dependent responses to both internal (energy requirement) and external (risk management) forces may have an effect on GUDs. We addressed this topic by conducting an extensive meta-analysis of published data on granivorous rodents, including 292 GUD measurements reported in 25 papers. The data set includes data on 22 granivorous rodent species belonging to three taxonomic suborders (Castorimorpha, Myomorpha, and Sciuromorpha) and spans three habitat types (desert, grassland, and forest). The observations refer to both patches subject to predation risk and safe patches. Pooling all data, we observed positive allometric scaling of GUDs with average forager size (scaling exponent = 0.45), which explained 15% of overall variance in individual GUDs. Perceived predation risk during foraging led to an increase in GUDs independently of forager size and taxonomy and of habitat type, which explained an additional 12% of overall GUD variance. The size scaling exponent of GUDs is positive across habitat types and taxonomic suborders of rodents. Some variation was observed, however. The scaling coefficients in grassland and forest habitat types were significantly higher than in the desert habitat type. In addition, Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha exhibited a more pronounced size scaling of GUDs than Castorimorpha. This suggests that different adaptive behaviors may be used in different contexts and/or from different foragers. With body size being a fundamental ecological descriptor, research into size scaling of GUDs may help to place patch-use observations in a broader allometric framework.","2019","2020-08-04 15:28:31","2020-08-04 15:29:02","2020-08-04 15:28:31","e02800","","10","100","","","Size dependency of patch departure behavior","","","","","","","en","© 2019.

While nectar provides mostly carbohydrates, pollen represents the main source of protein and lipids for many pollinators. However, the main function of pollen is to carry nutrients for pollen tube growth and thus fertilization. It is unclear whether pollinator attraction exerts a sufficiently strong selective pressure to alter the nutritional profile of pollen, e.g., through increasing its crude protein content or protein-to-lipid ratio, which both strongly affect bee foraging. Pollen nutritional quality may also be merely determined by phylogenetic relatedness, with pollen of closely related plants showing similar nutritional profiles due to shared biosynthetic pathways or floral morphologies. Here, we present a meta-analysis of studies on pollen nutrients to test whether differences in pollen nutrient contents and ratios correlated with plant insect pollinator dependence and/or phylogenetic relatedness. We hypothesized that if pollen nutritional content was affected by pollinator attraction, it should be different (e.g., higher) in highly pollinator-dependent plants, independent of phylogenetic relatedness. We found that crude protein and the protein-to-lipid ratio in pollen strongly correlated with phylogeny. Moreover, pollen protein content was higher in plants depending mostly or exclusively on insect pollination. Pollen nutritional quality thus correlated with both phylogenetic relatedness and pollinator dependency, indicating that, besides producing pollen with sufficient nutrients for reproduction, the nutrient profile of zoophilous plants may have been shaped by their pollinators’ nutritional needs.","2019-10-01","2020-08-04 15:30:03","2020-08-04 15:30:30","2020-08-04 15:30:03","349-358","","2","191","","Oecologia","Pollinator or pedigree","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB021","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6SC5EWVJ\Ruedenauer et al. - 2019 - Pollinator or pedigree which factors determine th.pdf","","Scopus Search B","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to synthetize current knowledge and provide future directions for research we performed a meta-analysis assessing the impact of invasive alien plant species on soil fauna abundance. Compared to previous synthesis on this topic, we included together in our model the trophic group of each soil faunal taxa (from herbivores to predators) and habitat structure, namely open and closed habitats (i.e. grass and shrub dominated areas versus forested areas). In doing so, we highlighted that both moderators strongly interact to determine the response of soil fauna to the presence of invasive alien plants. Soil fauna abundance increase in the presence of invasive species only in closed habitats (+18.2%). This pattern of habitat-dependent response (positive effect in closed habitats) was only found for primary consumers (i.e. herbivores +29.1% and detritivores +66.7%) within both detritus-based and live root-based trophic pathways. Abundances of predators and microbivores did not respond to the presence of IAS irrespective of habitat structure. For several groups, the habitat structure (open or closed) significantly drove their responses to the presence of invasive alien species. In addition, we carefully considered potential sources of bias (e.g. geographic, taxonomic and functional) within the collected data in an attempt to highlight gaps in available knowledge on the subject. Our findings support the conclusions of previous studies on the subject by demonstrating 1) that soil fauna abundance is impacted by biological invasions, 2) that initial habitat structure has a strong influence on the outcome and 3) that responses within the soil fauna differ between trophic levels with a stronger response of primary consumers.","2019","2020-08-04 15:31:38","2020-08-04 15:32:15","2020-08-04 15:31:38","1390-1401","","10","128","","","Soil fauna responses to invasive alien plants are determined by trophic groups and habitat structure","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

A recently published meta-analysis compiled the strength of plant facilitative interactions in the presence or absence (or reduced abundance) of mycorrhizal fungi. We use phylogenetically informed Bayesian linear models to test whether the effect size is influenced by the phylogenetic distance between the plant species involved in each plant facilitative interaction. Conspecific facilitative interactions are more strongly enhanced by mycorrhizal fungi than interactions between closely related species. In heterospecific interactions, the effect of the mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant facilitation increases with the phylogenetic distance between the nurse and facilitated plant species.

Meta-analyses comparing reciprocal transplant studies across various taxa confirmed this pattern, whereas single studies including various spatial scales are rare. We transplanted plants among locations of six populations of the herbaceous plant Anthyllis vulneraria in the European Alps. We assessed survival and measured aboveground biomass, reproductive allocation and flowering propensity to test for local adaptation at two spatial scales: within and between two climatically contrasting regions in the Eastern and Western Swiss Alps. Performance of transplanted Anthyllis vulneraria varied between spatial scales. Transplant survival did not show patterns of local adaptation. However, total aboveground biomass, reproductive allocation and flowering propensity were lowest when plants were transplanted to another region, compared with transplantations within regions and to the site of origin. These results indicate local adaptation of populations across regions, but not within regions. Our findings suggest that environmental variation across alpine regions, potentially the contrasting precipitation pattern, is a strong driver of local adaptation. A previous microsatellite study suggested that gene flow is restricted even within populations; therefore, the absence of local adaptation within regions is likely due to weak environmental variation rather than to gene flow counteracting local adaptation.","2019-10-01","2020-08-04 15:34:53","2020-08-04 15:35:17","2020-08-04 15:34:53","737-750","","5","33","","Evol Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB024","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I7X62T4V\Kesselring et al. - 2019 - Local adaptation is stronger between than within r.pdf","","Scopus Search B","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is therefore widely expected that male ejaculate traits, such as sperm and seminal fluid, will exhibit reduced quantity and quality when dietary nutrients are limited. However, reported patterns of ejaculate condition dependence are highly variable, and there has been no comprehensive synthesis of underlying sources of such variation in condition-dependent responses. In particular, it remains unclear whether all ejaculate traits are equally sensitive to nutrient intake, and whether such traits are particularly sensitive to certain dietary nutrients, respond more strongly to nutrients during specific life stages, or respond more strongly in some taxonomic groups. We systematically reviewed these potential sources of variation through a meta-analysis across 50 species of arthropods and vertebrates (from 71 papers and 348 effect sizes). We found that overall, ejaculate traits are moderately reduced when dietary nutrients are limited, but we also detected substantial variation in responses. Seminal fluid quantity was strongly and consistently condition dependent, while sperm quantity was moderately condition dependent. By contrast, aspects of sperm quality (particularly sperm viability and morphology) were less consistently reduced under nutrient limitation. Ejaculate traits tended to respond in a condition-dependent manner to a wide range of dietary manipulations, especially to caloric and protein restriction. Finally, while all major taxa for which sufficient data exist (i.e. arthropods, mammals, fish) showed condition dependence of ejaculate traits, we detected some taxonomic differences in the life stage that is most sensitive to nutrient limitation, and in the degree of condition dependence of specific ejaculate traits. Together, these biologically relevant factors accounted for nearly 20% of the total variance in ejaculate responses to nutrient limitation. Interestingly, body size showed considerably stronger condition-dependent responses compared to ejaculate traits, suggesting that ejaculate trait expression may be strongly canalised to protect important reproductive functions, or that the cost of producing an ejaculate is relatively low. Taken together, our findings show that condition-dependence of ejaculate traits is taxonomically widespread, but there are also many interesting, biologically relevant sources of variation that require further investigation. In particular, further research is needed to understand the differences in selective pressures that result in differential patterns of ejaculate condition dependence across taxa and ejaculate traits.","2019","2020-08-04 15:36:18","2020-08-04 15:36:47","2020-08-04 15:36:18","1722-1739","","5","94","","","Effects of nutrient limitation on sperm and seminal fluid","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB025 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12524","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QETI6LPE\Macartney et al. - 2019 - Effects of nutrient limitation on sperm and semina.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XARI3ZWV\brv.html","","Scopus Search B","condition dependence; nutrient limitation; life history; diet; body-size; ejaculate; post-copulatory; protein; semen; sperm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maternal effects account for half as much phenotypic variation within populations as do additive genetic effects. Maternal effects most greatly affect morphology and phenology but, surprisingly, are not stronger in species with prolonged maternal care than in species without. While maternal effects influence juvenile traits more than adult traits on average, they do not decline across ontogeny for behaviour or physiology, and they do not weaken across the life cycle in species without maternal care. These findings underscore maternal effects as an important source of phenotypic variation and emphasise their potential to affect many ecological and evolutionary processes.","2019","2020-08-04 15:37:52","2020-08-04 15:38:28","2020-08-04 15:37:52","1620-1628","","10","22","","","A mother’s legacy","","","","","","","en","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB026 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ele.13351","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2YXQ7I5Z\Moore et al. - 2019 - A mother’s legacy the strength of maternal effect.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\H89RFB7W\ele.html","","Scopus Search B","meta-analysis; quantitative genetics; Animal model; life-history theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The negative effects of elevated O3 on plants have been widely studied and are well understood nowadays. However, how the effects of elevated O3 on plants may be driven by N deposition remains an unsolved puzzle. We conducted a meta-analysis and showed that the negative effects of elevated O3 on photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, growth and biomass production of semi-natural and natural vegetation may remain unchanged by N deposition in the coming future under realistic increases in O3 concentrations (+20 to 40 ppb) and N deposition (up to 60 kg ha−1 year−1). The negative effect of elevated O3 on chlorophyll content is offset by soil N addition; however, the negative effect on biomasses is not offset by soil N addition. Across functional groups and O3 levels, N addition exacerbated O3 effects on root when N increased from 0–10 kg N ha−1 year−1 to 11–30 kg N ha−1 year−1. However, an analysis as per the plant functional group revealed that such a N-dependent O3 effect was significant only in perennial non-woody plants, and was non-significant when only realistic increases in O3 concentrations were considered. Likewise, N addition appeared to exacerbate O3-negative effects on photosynthesis of trees when N increased from 0–30 kg N ha−1 year−1 to >60 kg N ha−1 year−1; however, this effect was significant only when realistic increases in O3 concentrations were considered. The results suggest potential error in the current estimates of the overall O3 impacts on plants due to no consideration of soil N availability, and encourage further studies on the interaction of O3 and N availability that will permit more robust analyses in the future. Elevated O3 will likely remain a persistent agricultural and ecological issue independently of N deposition.

We investigated patterns of crab distribution and the relationship between crabs and vegetation in salt marshes at multiple scales. By using consistent monitoring protocols across 15 U.S. National Estuarine Research Reserves, we were able to synthesize patterns from the scale of quadrats to the entire marsh landscape to regional and national scales. Some generalities emerged across marshes from our overall models, and these are useful for informing broad coastal management policy. We found that crab burrow distribution within a marsh could be predicted by marsh elevation, distance to creek and soil compressibility. While these physical factors also affected marsh vegetation cover, we did not find a strong or consistent overall effect of crabs at a broad scale in our multivariate model, though regressions conducted separately for each site revealed that crab burrows were negatively correlated with vegetation cover at 4 out of 15 sites. This contrasts with recent smaller-scale studies and meta-analyses synthesizing such studies that detected strong negative effects of crabs on marshes, likely because we sampled across the entire marsh landscape, while targeted studies are typically limited to low-lying areas near creeks, where crab burrow densities are highest. Our results suggest that sea-level rise generally poses a bigger threat to marshes than crabs, but there will likely be interactions between these physical and biological factors. Beyond these generalities across marshes, we detected some regional differences in crab community composition, richness, and abundance. However, we found striking differences among sites within regions, and within sites, in terms of crab abundance and relationships to marsh integrity. Although generalities are broadly useful, our findings indicate that local managers cannot rely on data from other nearby systems, but rather need local information for developing salt marsh management strategies.","2019","2020-08-04 15:41:10","2020-08-04 15:41:52","2020-08-04 15:41:10","e02813","","10","100","","","Pattern and scale","","","","","","","en","© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB028 _eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecy.2813","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WLB2EW59\Wasson et al. - 2019 - Pattern and scale evaluating generalities in crab.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XYGHD8F2\ecy.html","","Scopus Search B","plant–herbivore interactions; conservation; salt marsh; consumer; decapod crustacean; long-term monitoring; National Estuarine Research Reserves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anthropogenic activities have considerably increased nitrogen (N) deposition, which significant affects plant phenology. Although numerous individual studies have been conducted, it remains controversial how N addition affects phenological stages, and a comprehensive understanding of how plant phenology responds to external N inputs remains elusive. To reconcile the differences, we conducted a meta-analysis of 117 species to examine the responses of plant phenology to N addition in terrestrial ecosystems, and assessed variations in their responses in relation to ecosystem types, functional groups, and environmental conditions. Our results showed that plant phenology changed significantly after N addition, and phenology time delayed and phenology duration shortened significantly across all biomes except fruiting duration, but varied with biome types. The phenology change in cropland was more dramatical than in grassland after N addition, even in opposite directions. The response of phenological stages to N addition was consistent in two pollination types except the flowering time, the flowering time had no change in anemophilous but significantly delayed in entomophilous. In addition, the response of phenology to N addition was discrepancy among functional groups, the phenology time advanced and duration shortened in sedge, while phenology time delayed and duration shortened in other groups, and the phenology change in legume was larger than grass and forbs. We also found that environmental factors had little effects on the response of plant phenology to N addition, but significant correlation was found between the response ratios of different phenological stages. Our study suggested that phenology was sensitive to N deposition at many phenological stages, and changes in phenology may be smaller with community biodiversity increasing at ecosystem level.","2019","2020-08-04 15:44:45","2020-08-04 15:45:38","2020-08-04 15:44:45","1243-1253","","9","128","","","Responses of plant phenology to nitrogen addition","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB030 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/oik.06099","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AXCTXHQM\Wang and Tang - 2019 - Responses of plant phenology to nitrogen addition.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TTAJ4C46\oik.html","","Scopus Search B","diversity; functional group; N deposition; phenology; reproductive duration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is momentum for implementing green infrastructure (GI), such as green roofs, wetland detention basins and community gardens, that partially offset these impacts and that benefit human health. GI is often designed to explicitly support ecosystem services, including implied benefits to biodiversity. The effects of GI on biodiversity have been rarely quantified, but research on this topic has increased exponentially in the last decade and a synthesis of the literature is needed. Here, we examined 1,883 published manuscripts and conducted a meta-analysis on 33 studies that were relevant. We determined whether GI provides additional benefits to biodiversity over conventional infrastructure or natural counterparts. We also highlighted research gaps and identified opportunities to improve future applications. We determined that GI significantly improves biodiversity over conventional infrastructure equivalents, and that in some cases GI had comparable measures of biodiversity to natural counterparts. Many studies were omitted from these analyses because we found GI research has generally neglected conventional experimental design frameworks, including controls, replication or adequate sampling effort. Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis identified that taxa specificity is an important consideration for green infrastructure (GI) design relative to the more common measurements at the community level. We also identified that ignoring multi-trophic interactions and landscape-level patterns can limit our understanding of GI effects on biodiversity. We recommend further examination of species-specific differences among infrastructures (i.e. green, conventional or natural equivalents) or using functional traits to improve the efficacy of GI implementation on urban biodiversity. Furthermore, we encourage policy makers and practitioners to improve the design of GI to benefit urban ecosystems because of the potential benefits for both humans and global biodiversity.","2019","2020-08-04 15:49:09","2020-08-04 15:49:55","2020-08-04 15:49:08","2131-2143","","9","56","","","The contribution of constructed green infrastructure to urban biodiversity","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we focused on interindividual differences in innovation by (1) extensively reviewing existing literature on innovative behaviour in animals and (2) quantitatively testing the different evolutionary hypotheses that have been proposed to explain interindividual variation in innovation propensity during foraging tasks. We ran a series of phylogenetically controlled mixed-effects meta-regression models to determine which hypotheses (if any) are supported by currently available empirical studies. Our analyses show that innovation is more common in individuals that are older and belong to the larger sex, but also in more neophilic and/or explorative individuals. Moreover, these effects change depending on the study setting (i.e. wild versus captive).

Several studies have confirmed that either male sexual ornamentation is associated with EPP or that phenotypes of cuckolded and cuckolding males differ. Expression of male ornamentation may change with age; however, a recent meta-analysis has identified age itself as an important factor that differed in cuckolding and cuckolded males. The age of social female partner may also affect EPP, though this has received little attention. Here, by using detailed data on age of individual barn swallows (Hirundo rustica rustica), we identified age as the major predictor of male and female promiscuity. Our results revealed that, whereas a male’s ability to obtain an extra-pair mate increased linearly with age, the only predictor of the probability of a male being cuckolded was the age of his social partner, with older females engaging more frequently in EPP. In contrast, male ornamentation was not significantly related to EPP pattern. Tarsus length was the sole significant phenotypic trait in comparison between cuckolding and cuckolded males. Our data provide little support for the hypothesis that extra-pair mate choice in our barn swallow population was ornament driven. This may indicate either a non-adaptive scenario for EPP, for example with older males better able to coerce females into copulation, or EPP mating based on other than absolute mate-choice criteria associated with the expression of male ornamentation.","2019-08-06","2020-08-04 15:55:00","2020-08-04 15:55:32","2020-08-04 15:55:00","119","","9","73","","Behav Ecol Sociobiol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB033","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UCFR2PLW\Michálková et al. - 2019 - Extra-pair paternity patterns in European barn swa.pdf","","Scopus Search B","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we determine the relative importance of plant evolutionary history, traits, and environmental factors for coexistence through PSF using a meta-analysis of 1038 pairwise PSF measures. Consistent with eco-evolutionary predictions, feedback is more likely to mediate coexistence for pairs of plant species (1) associating with similar guilds of mycorrhizal fungi, (2) of increasing phylogenetic distance, and (3) interacting with native microbes. We also found evidence for a primary role of pathogens in feedback-mediated coexistence.

A large database including 500 experiments with 760 plant species enabled us to determine generalized dose–response curves. Many traits increase with DLI in a saturating fashion. Some showed a more than 10-fold increase over the DLI range of 1–50 mol m−2 d−1, such as the number of seeds produced per plant and the actual rate of photosynthesis. Strong decreases with DLI (up to three-fold) were observed for leaf area ratio and leaf payback time. Plasticity differences among species groups were generally small compared with the overall responses to DLI. However, for a number of traits, including photosynthetic capacity and realized growth, we found woody and shade-tolerant species to have lower plasticity. We further conclude that the direction and degree of trait changes adheres with responses to plant density and to vertical light gradients within plant canopies. This synthesis provides a strong quantitative basis for understanding plant acclimation to light, from molecular to whole plant responses, but also identifies the variables that currently form weak spots in our knowledge, such as respiration and reproductive characteristics.","2019","2020-08-04 15:59:20","2020-08-04 15:59:55","2020-08-04 15:59:20","1073-1105","","3","223","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

These abundant species are often referred to as dominant species. Yet, despite their importance, the term dominant species is poorly defined and often used to convey different information by different authors. Based on a review of historical and contemporary definitions we develop a synthetic definition of dominant species. This definition incorporates the relative local abundance of a species, its ubiquity across the landscape, and its impact on community and ecosystem properties. A meta-analysis of removal studies shows that the loss of species identified as dominant by authors can significantly impact ecosystem functioning and community structure. We recommend two metrics that can be used jointly to identify dominant species in a given community and provide a roadmap for future avenues of research on dominant species. In our review, we make the case that the identity and effects of dominant species on their environments are key to linking patterns of diversity to ecosystem function, including predicting impacts of species loss and other aspects of global change on ecosystems.","2019","2020-08-04 16:01:16","2020-08-04 16:01:46","2020-08-04 16:01:16","1106-1126","","3","223","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

The Gadgil effect, where competition between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi for nitrogen slows litter decomposition, may increase soil carbon. However, experimental evidence for the Gadgil effect is equivocal. Here, we apply resource-ratio theory to assess whether interguild fungal competition for different forms of organic nitrogen can affect litter decomposition. We focus on variation in resource input ratios and fungal resource use traits, and evaluate our model's predictions by synthesizing prior experimental literature examining ectomycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition. In our model, resource input ratios determined whether ectomycorrhizal fungi suppressed saprotrophic fungi. Recalcitrant litter inputs favored the former over the latter, allowing the Gadgil effect only when such inputs predominated. Although ectomycorrhizal fungi did not always hamper litter decomposition, ectomycorrhizal nitrogen uptake always increased carbon : nitrogen ratios in litter. Our meta-analysis of empirical studies supports our theoretical results: ectomycorrhizal fungi appear to slow decomposition of leaf litter only in forests where litter inputs are highly recalcitrant. We thus find that the specific contribution of the Gadgil effect to high soil carbon : nitrogen ratios in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems may be smaller than predicted previously.","2019","2020-08-04 16:03:08","2020-08-04 16:03:34","2020-08-04 16:03:08","1595-1606","","3","223","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

Sex differences were identified from a systematic literature search of meta-analyses and large-sample studies. These were organized in terms of evolutionary significance as follows: (i) characteristics arising from inter-male competition (within-sex aggression; impulsiveness and sensation-seeking; fearfulness; visuospatial and object-location memory; object-centred orientations); (ii) those concerning social relations that are likely to have arisen from women's adaptations for small-group interactions and men's for larger co-operative groups (person-centred orientation and social skills; language; depression and anxiety); (iii) those arising from female choice (sexuality; mate choice; sexual conflict). There were sex differences in all categories, whose magnitudes ranged from (i) small (object location memory; negative emotions), to (ii) medium (mental rotation; anxiety disorders; impulsivity; sex drive; interest in casual sex), to (iii) large (social interests and abilities; sociosexuality); and (iv) very large (escalated aggression; systemizing; sexual violence). Evolutionary explanations were evaluated according to whether: (i) similar differences occur in other mammals; (ii) there is cross-cultural consistency; (iii) the origin was early in life or at puberty; (iv) there was evidence for hormonal influences; and (v), where possible, whether there was evidence for evolutionarily derived design features. The evidence was positive for most features in most categories, suggesting evolutionary origins for a broad range of sex differences. Attributes for which there was no sex difference are also noted.

Despite the important theoretical advances provided by these models, empirical evidence indicates that rules adopted by animals to settle contests vary among species. This stimulated recent discussions about the generality and applicability of models of contest. A meta-analysis may be helpful to answer questions such as: (i) is there a common contest rule to settle contests; (ii) do contest characteristics, such as the occurrence of physical contact during the fight, influence the use of specific contest rules; and (iii) is there a phylogenetic signal behind contest rules? To answer these questions, we gathered information on the relationship between contest duration and traits linked to contestants' resource holding potential (RHP) for randomly paired rivals and RHP-matched rivals. We also gathered behavioural data about contest escalation and RHP asymmetry. In contests between randomly paired rivals, we found a positive relationship between contest duration and loser RHP but did not find any pattern for winners. We also found a low phylogenetic signal and a similar response for species that fight with and without physical contact. In RHP-matched rivals, we found a positive relationship between contest duration and the mean RHP of the pair. Finally, we found a negative relation between contest escalation and RHP asymmetry, even though it was more variable than the other results. Our results thus indicate that rivals settle contests following the rules predicted by WOA and E-WOA in most species. However, we also found inconsistencies between the behaviours exhibited during contests and the assumptions of WOA models in most species. We discuss additional (and relatively untested) theoretical possibilities that may be explored to resolve the existing inconsistencies.","2019","2020-08-04 16:06:39","2020-08-04 16:07:13","2020-08-04 16:06:39","1430-1442","","4","94","","","All by myself?","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB040 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12509","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ECGMUFT2\Pinto et al. - 2019 - All by myself Meta-analysis of animal contests sh.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VFAPEFAA\brv.html","","Scopus Search B","meta-regression; territoriality; agonistic interaction; cumulative assessment model; resource-holding potential; sequential assessment model; war of attrition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present here a global assessment of NNT effects on the three main categories of ecosystem services, including regulating (RES), provisioning (PES) and cultural services (CES), and on an ecosystem disservice (EDS), i.e. pollen allergenicity. By searching the scientific literature, country forestry reports, and social media, we compiled a global data set of 1683 case studies from over 125 NNT species, covering 44 countries, all continents but Antarctica, and seven biomes. Using different meta-analysis techniques, we found that, while NNTs increase most RES (e.g. climate regulation, soil erosion control, fertility and formation), they decrease PES (e.g. NNTs contribute less than native trees to global timber provision). Also, they have different effects on CES (e.g. increase aesthetic values but decrease scientific interest), and no effect on the EDS considered. NNT effects on each ecosystem (dis)service showed a strong context dependency, varying across NNT types, biomes and socio-economic conditions. For instance, some RES are increased more by NNTs able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, and when the ecosystem is located in low-latitude biomes; some CES are increased more by NNTs in less-wealthy countries or in countries with higher gross domestic products. The effects of NNTs on several ecosystem (dis)services exhibited some synergies (e.g. among soil fertility, soil formation and climate regulation or between aesthetic values and pollen allergenicity), but also trade-offs (e.g. between fire regulation and soil erosion control). Our analyses provide a quantitative understanding of the complex synergies, trade-offs and context dependencies involved for the effects of NNTs that is essential for attaining a sustained provision of ecosystem services.","2019","2020-08-04 16:08:03","2020-08-04 16:08:42","2020-08-04 16:08:03","1477-1501","","4","94","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

This rule is named after C.W.L. Gloger who was one of the first to summarise the associations between climatic variation and animal colouration, noting in particular that birds and mammals seemed more pigmented in tropical regions. The term ‘Gloger's rule' was coined by B. Rensch in 1929 and included different patterns of variation from those described by Gloger. Rensch defined the rule in two ways: a simple version stating that endothermic animals are predicted to be darker in warmer and humid areas due to the increased deposition of melanin pigments; and a complex version that includes the differential effects of humidity and temperature on both main types of melanin pigments – eu- and phaeo-melanin. The blackish eu-melanins are predicted to increase with humidity, and decrease only at extreme low temperatures, while the brown-yellowish phaeomelanins prevail in dry and warm regions and decrease rapidly with lower temperatures. A survey of the literature indicates that there is considerable variation/confusion in the way Gloger's rule is understood (based on 271 studies that define the rule). Whereas the complex version is hardly mentioned, only a quarter of the definitions are consistent with the simple version of Gloger's rule (darker where warm and wet), and most definitions mention only the effects of humidity (darker where wet). A smaller subset of studies define the rule based on other correlated climatic and environmental variables such as vegetation, latitude, altitude, solar radiation, etc., and a few even contradict the original definition (darker where cold). Based on the literature survey, I synthesised the qualitative (N = 124 studies) and quantitative (meta-analytically, N = 38 studies, 241 effects) evidence testing the simple version of Gloger's rule (I found no tests of the complex version). Both lines of evidence supported the predicted effects of humidity (and closely linked variables) on colour variation, but not the effects of temperature. Moreover, humidity effects are not restricted to birds and mammals, as the data indicate that these effects also apply to insects. This suggests that the simple version of Gloger's rule as originally defined may not be valid, and possibly that the rule should be re-formulated in terms of humidity effects only. I suggest, however, that more data are needed before such a reformulation, due to potential publication biases. In conclusion, I recommend that authors cite Rensch when referring to Gloger's rule and that they make clear which version they are referring to. Future research should concentrate on rigorously testing the validity and generality of both versions of Gloger's rule and establishing the mechanism(s) responsible for the patterns it describes. Since humidity seems to be the core climatic variable behind Gloger's rule, I suggest that the two most plausible mechanisms are camouflage and protection against parasites/pathogens, the latter possibly through pleiotropic effects on the immune system. Understanding the processes that lead to climatic effects on animal colouration may provide insights into past and future patterns of adaptation to climatic change.","2019","2020-08-04 16:09:49","2020-08-04 16:10:29","2020-08-04 16:09:49","1294-1316","","4","94","","","A review of Gloger's rule, an ecogeographical rule of colour","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB042 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12503","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EIQI5FD5\Delhey - 2019 - A review of Gloger's rule, an ecogeographical rule.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SVTH5DGV\brv.html","","Scopus Search B","climate; biogeography; temperature; Gloger's rule; humidity; melanin; pigmentation; thermal melanism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the response of soil microbial communities and their function to depleted C availability in situ is unclear. We evaluated the role of soil C inputs in controlling microbial biomass, community composition, physiology, and function by (1) experimentally excluding plant C inputs in situ for 9 yr in four temperate forest ecosystems along a productivity gradient in Oregon, USA; and (2) integrating these findings with published data from similar C-exclusion studies into a global meta-analysis. Excluding plant C inputs for 9 yr resulted in a 13% decrease in SOC across the four Oregon sites and an overall shift in the microbial community composition, with a 45% decrease in the fungal : bacterial ratio and a 13% increase in Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio. Although gross N mineralization decreased under C exclusion, decreases in gross N immobilization were greater, resulting in increased net N mineralization rates in all but the lowest-productivity site. Microbial biomass showed a variable response to C exclusion that was method dependent; however, we detected a 29% decrease in C-use efficiency across the sites, with greater declines occurring in less-productive sites. Although extracellular enzyme activity increased with C exclusion, C exclusion resulted in a 31% decrease in microbial respiration across all sites. Our meta-analyses of published data with similar C-exclusion treatments were largely consistent with our experimental results, showing decreased SOC, fungal : bacterial ratios, and microbial respiration, and increased Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio following exclusion of C inputs to soil. Effect sizes of SOC and respiration correlated negatively with the duration of C exclusion; however, there were immediate effects of C exclusion on microbial community composition and biomass that were unaltered by duration of treatment. Our field-based experimental results and analyses demonstrate unequivocally the dominant control of C availability on soil microbial biomass, community composition, and function, and provide additional insight into the mechanisms for these effects in forest ecosystems.","2019","2020-08-04 16:11:39","2020-08-04 16:12:24","2020-08-04 16:11:39","e02695","","7","100","","","Carbon control on terrestrial ecosystem function across contrasting site productivities","","","","","","","en","© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB043 _eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecy.2695","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BMQYEX8G\Dove et al. - 2019 - Carbon control on terrestrial ecosystem function a.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7Z27LNTM\ecy.html","","Scopus Search B","meta-analysis; 15N pool dilution; carbon-use efficiency; extracellular enzyme activity; gross N immobilization; gross N mineralization; microbial ecology; microbial respiration; nitrogen cycle; phospholipid fatty acid analysis; soil carbon availability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, interventions aiming to increase DW might be necessary to support its associated biodiversity, even in protected forests, which may be former production forests. Our aim was to synthesize the current state of knowledge drawn from replicated experimental studies into solid quantitative evidence of the effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity, with a focus on protected forests. We conducted a full systematic review of effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. We included three intervention types: creation of DW from live trees at the site, addition of DW from outside the site and prescribed burning. Outcomes included abundance and species richness of saproxylic insects, ground insects, wood-inhabiting fungi, lichens, reptiles and cavity-nesting birds. In total, we included 91 studies, 37 of which were used in meta-analyses. Although meta-analysis outcomes were heterogeneous, they showed that increasing the amount of DW (“DW enrichment”) has positive effects on the abundance and richness of saproxylic insects and fungi. The positive effect on saproxylic pest insect abundance tended to be less than that on saproxylic insects in general. No significant effects were found for ground insects or cavity-nesting birds. Although reviewed studies were mainly short term, our results support that management that increases DW amounts has the potential to increase the abundance of DW-dependent species and, in most cases, also their species richness. Studies of burning showed positive effects on the abundance of saproxylic insects similar to those of other interventions, even though burning on average resulted in a smaller enrichment of DW amounts. Policy implications. The findings of the review suggest that manipulating dead wood (DW) can be an effective part of conservation management to support biodiversity in protected areas. The findings also indicate that the diversity of DW types is important, a mix of DW qualities should be favoured. Burning seems to be an effective method to increase biodiversity but to benefit cavity-nesting birds, snag losses need to be minimized.","2019","2020-08-04 16:13:25","2020-08-04 16:13:58","2020-08-04 16:13:25","1770-1781","","7","56","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors Journal of Applied Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB044 _eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.13395","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\R5GWXIH9\Sandström et al. - 2019 - Impacts of dead wood manipulation on the biodivers.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NQSUTED8\1365-2664.html","","Scopus Search B","diversity; prescribed burning; habitat management; coarse woody debris; dead wood; forest conservation; forest restoration; saproxylic species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By means of hierarchical and phylogenetically independent meta-analyses we reviewed habitat fragmentation effects on the genetic and biological characteristics of progenies across 179 plant species. Progeny sired in fragmented habitats showed overall genetic erosion in contrast with progeny sired in continuous habitats, with the exception of plants pollinated by vertebrates. Similarly, plant progeny in fragmented habitats showed reduced germination, survival and growth. Habitat fragmentation had stronger negative effects on the progeny vigour of outcrossing- than mixed-mating plant species, except for vertebrate-pollinated species. Finally, we observed that increased inbreeding coefficients due to fragmentation correlated negatively with progeny vigour.

We undertook a global analysis, compiling FA profiles of 106 chondrichthyan (shark, ray and chimaera) populations, as a model to test the utility of FA profiles to partition a priori trophic guilds, phylogeny, water temperature and habitats. Individual FAs characterizing these four factors were identified, promoting the use of these FAs as ecological tracers across taxa. Habitat type was linked to five FAs: 16:0, 18:0 and biologically essential 22:6ω3 (indicative of the deep sea), 20:5ω3 (non-complex demersal and deep-sea demersal) and 20:4ω6 (reef and brackish water). Temperature was a key driver of four FAs (22:5ω6, 22:4ω6, 20:1ω9 and 20:5ω3), while trophic guild and phylogeny were important drivers of two pairs of FA tracers (18:0 and 20:5ω3; 20:1ω9 and 18:1ω9, respectively). This analysis provides a novel understanding of the biological and ecological information that can be inferred from FA profiles and further validates the use of FAs as tracers to investigate the trophic ecology of chondrichthyans. Future research should prioritize ex situ studies to further disentangle the influence of factors across taxa and tissue types, quantify biomodification, enabling the use of quantitative methods for diet determination and further develop ‘FATscapes’ to elucidate fine-scale trophic geography and climate variability. Additionally, the creation of a taxonomically inclusive FA data repository will enable further meta-analyses.

Several factors have been hypothesized to mediate this relationship. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of >70 studies comprised of >8000 individuals reporting relationships between measures of maintenance metabolic rates (i.e. basal metabolic rate, resting metabolic rate, and standard metabolic rate) and behaviour. We evaluated support for three hypothesized mediators: (i) type of behaviour, (ii) opportunities for energy re-allocation, and (iii) magnitude of energetic constraints. Relationships between measures of maintenance metabolic rate (MR) and behaviour are predicted to be strongest for behaviours with strong consequences for energy turnover (acquisition or expenditure). Consistent with this, we found that behaviours with known consequences for energy gain (e.g. foraging, dominance, boldness) or expenditure (e.g. maximum sprint speed, sustained running speed, maximum distance travelled, etc.) had strong positive correlations with MR, while behaviours with putatively weak and/or inconsistent associations with net energy gain or loss (e.g. exploration, activity, sociability) were not correlated with MR. Greater opportunities for energy reallocation are predicted to weaken relationships between MR and behaviour by creating alternative pathways to balance energy budgets. We tested this by contrasting relationships between MR and behaviour in ectotherms versus endotherms, as thermoregulation in endotherms creates additional opportunities for energy reallocation compared with ectotherms. As predicted, the relationship between behaviour and MR was stronger in ectotherms compared with endotherms. However, statistical analyses of heterogeneity among effect sizes from different species did not support energy re-allocation as the main driver of these differences. Finally, we tested whether conditions where animals face greater constraints in meeting their energy budgets (e.g. field versus laboratory, breeding versus non-breeding) increased the strength of the relationship between MR and behaviour. We found that the relationship between MR and behaviour was unaffected by either of these modifiers. This meta-analysis provides two key insights. First, we observed positive relationships of similar magnitude between MR and behaviours that bring in net energy, and behaviours that cost net energy. This result is only consistent with a performance energy-management model. Given that the studies included in our meta-analysis represent a wide range of taxa, this suggests that the performance model may be the most common model in general. Second, we found that behaviours with putatively weak or inconsistent consequences for net energy gain or expenditure (exploration, activity, sociability) show no relationship with MR. The lack of relationship between MR and behavioural traits with weak and/or inconsistent consequences for energy turnover provides the first systematic demonstration of the central importance of the ecological function of traits in mediating relationships between MR and behaviour.","2019","2020-08-04 16:19:24","2020-08-04 16:20:06","2020-08-04 16:19:24","1056-1074","","3","94","","","The covariance between metabolic rate and behaviour varies across behaviours and thermal types","","","","","","","en","© 2018 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB048 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12491","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FBMI8MSK\Mathot et al. - 2019 - The covariance between metabolic rate and behaviou.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PAHYIY44\brv.html","","Scopus Search B","resting metabolic rate; standard metabolic rate; basal metabolic rate; animal personality; among-individual differences; energetic constraints; energy management strategy; routine metabolic rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, many studies have focused on how developmental stress can give rise to variation in adult behaviour, physiology, and performance. However, there remains a poor understanding of whether general patterns exist in the effects and magnitude of phenotypic responses across taxonomic groups. Furthermore, given the extensive phenotypic variation that arises from developmental stressors, it remains important to ascertain how multiple processes may explain these responses. We compiled data from 111 studies to examine and quantify the effect of developmental stress on animal phenotype and performance from juveniles to adulthood, including studies from birds, reptiles, fish, mammals, insects, arachnids, and amphibians. Using meta-analytic approaches, we show that across all studies there is, on average, a moderate to large negative effect of developmental stress exposure (posterior mean effect: |d| = −0.51) on animal phenotype or performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that interactive effects of timing of stressor onset and the duration of exposure to stressors best explained variation in developmental stress responses. Animals exposed to stressors earlier in development had more-positive responses than those with later onset, whereas longer duration of exposure to a stressor caused responses to be stronger in magnitude. However, the high amount of heterogeneity in our results, and the low degree of variance explained by fixed effects in both the meta-analysis (R2 = 0.034) and top-ranked meta-regression model (R2 = 0.02), indicate that phenotypic responses to developmental stressors are likely highly idiosyncratic in nature and difficult to predict. Despite this, our analyses address a critical knowledge gap in understanding what effect developmental stress has on phenotypic variation in animals. Additionally, our results highlight important environmental and proximate factors that may influence phenotypic responses to developmental stressors.","2019","2020-08-04 16:21:09","2020-08-04 16:21:59","2020-08-04 16:21:09","1143-1160","","3","94","","","Effects of developmental stress on animal phenotype and performance","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB049 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12496","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6BUDMAT2\Eyck et al. - 2019 - Effects of developmental stress on animal phenotyp.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\M5PAPFZZ\brv.html","","Scopus Search B","meta-analysis; meta-regression; phenotypic plasticity; developmental stress; cross taxa; phenotypic variation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Variation in the direction and strength of the NAR tends to be negative for small plot sizes and study extents, but positive for large plots and extents. This invasion paradox has been attributed to different processes driving species richness at different spatial scales. However, the focus on plot size has drawn attention away from other factors influencing the NAR, in part because the influence of other factors may be obscured by or interact with plot size. Here, we test whether variation in the NAR can be explained by covariates linked to community susceptibility to invasion and whether these interact with plot size using a quantitative meta-analysis drawn from 87 field studies that examined 161 NARs. While plot size explained most variation, the NAR was less positive in grassland habitats and in the Australasian region. Other covariates did not show strong relationships with the NAR even after accounting for interactions with plot size. Instead, much of the unexplained variation is associated with article or author specific differences, suggesting the NAR depends strongly on how different authors choose their study system or study design.","2019","2020-08-04 16:22:55","2020-08-04 16:23:40","2020-08-04 16:22:55","1038-1046","","6","22","","","Resolving the invasion paradox","","","","","","","en","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","","","","Wiley Online Library","","SearchID: SSB SearchResultID: MB050 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ele.13261","","C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RDUGLWPR\Tomasetto et al. - 2019 - Resolving the invasion paradox pervasive scale an.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\U2K7ZILV\ele.html","","Scopus Search B","effect size; meta-regression; biological invasions; Author effect; heterogeneity; spatial grain; weeds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
